Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has questioned Russia's ability to attack NATO countries, as it is not ""even capable of defeating Ukraine,"" he said in an interview with French TV channel LCI on June 8.

""The Russians are too weak for that,"" Orban said. ""They're not even capable of defeating Ukraine, so they're incapable of really attacking NATO.""

Over three years into its full-scale war, Russia has failed to achieve Ukraine's surrender or at least the complete occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, which was reportedly among the Kremlin's demands in Russia's first peace proposal in 2022.

Russian troops have recently intensified their offensive, moving deeper into Sumy Oblast, as well as closing in on Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.

Russian propaganda has for years insisted that NATO and its further expansion pose a threat to Moscow. The Kremlin has also claimed that Ukraine's ambition to join NATO was a major trigger for its invasion, although in 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea and started the war in the Donbas region, Ukraine's chances and desires of joining the alliance were low.

Orban, widely regarded as the European Union's most pro-Russian leader, said that it is not in the interests of the EU, including Hungary, to have ""a direct conflict with Russia"" or ""a threat of war,"" so Ukraine must not join NATO.

""Europe must be strengthened in the long term, and there must be a strategic agreement with Russia,"" Orban said, adding that sanctions against Russia are ""destroying Hungary and the whole of Europe.""

Under the Orban regime, Hungary has become widely regarded as the most Kremlin-friendly state in the EU.

Budapest has been blocking the opening of EU accession negotiation clusters with Kyiv and signaled further obstruction in recent weeks after Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) said it had uncovered a Hungarian spy network in western Ukraine.

Orban also encouraged Hungarians to vote in a non-binding national poll on Ukraine's EU bid that the government launched in early March. The poll has garnered criticism for low turnout and manipulative questions, written to encourage citizens to reject Ukraine's accession.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1239783290.jpg

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced on June 2 that the United Kingdom is moving to ""warfighting readiness,"" in large part in response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the threat Russia poses to Europe.

He made the comment as his government unveiled its latest Strategic Defense Review, which U.K. General Richard Barrons, one of the review's authors, described as the ""most profound"" change in U.K. defense in 150 years.

The review sets out ambitious new targets, including at least 12 new attack submarines, fleets of drones and autonomous vehicles, as well as 7,000 new long-range weapons.

Yet it also comes with urgent warnings.

The review reveals that the U.K.'s Armed Forces are currently unprepared to fight adversaries such as Russia or China, nor could they conduct high-intensity warfare in a war like that in Ukraine.

Insufficient munition stockpiles, low troop numbers, and ageing equipment are just a few of the weaknesses underpinning its assessment.

""The speed of development in Ukraine is so far ahead of what countries like the U.K. is capable of.""



But as well as committing to bolstering its own defense capabilities, the U.K. must also manage the commitments already made to Kyiv, which it has vowed to support with a ""100-year partnership.""

The U.K. has been one of Kyiv’s closest supporters since the start of the full-scale invasion, and the review reiterates long-term support for Ukraine, committing 3 billion pounds ($4.06 billion) annually in military aid.

""The bottom line is that all of this is about defending the U.K. after the conflict moves on from Ukraine primarily,"" Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, a U.K.-based think tank, told the Kyiv Independent.

""Whether it's positive, negative, or catastrophic, either way, that's when the U.K. and its allies need to be ready for Russia's next move.""

Lessons learned from Ukraine

The U.K. wants to create a more flexible procurement process, as demonstrated by that developed by Ukraine throughout the full-scale invasion, a dynamic it says would be vital should the U.K. deploy troops in support of a ceasefire.

The review urges deeper defense industrial collaboration, including joint ventures and helping Ukraine access global markets, as well as rebuilding and sustaining its defense sector.

This could include helping Ukraine service Soviet-era equipment still used abroad. The U.K. also aims to learn from Ukraine’s experience in modern warfare, particularly in land combat, drones, and hybrid threats.

However, the review highlights challenges — U.K. stockpiles of weapons such as Storm Shadow long-range missiles have been depleted through its support to Ukraine, and years of underinvestment have weakened domestic defense capacity.

The U.K. has announced that it will build six new munition factories. This indicates a significant attempt to address one of the key criticisms of European defense, which is its lack of industrial base and reliance on U.S. support.

While U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey has said that ""we should expect to see new factories opening very soon,"" it is not clear how quickly this will translate into meaningful battlefield assistance for Ukraine’s Armed Forces.

""The speed of development in Ukraine is so far ahead of what countries like the U.K. are capable of, the best-case outcome for Ukraine would just be sending the money there to build stuff,"" Giles said.

When asked how Ukraine could be best supported outside of the recommendations in the review, Giles said the ""maximum support"" should be given to Ukraine, without the hesitancy about doing damage to Russia.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/GettyImages-2211089295.jpg

A Russian court has sentenced two Ukrainian soldiers of the Azov Brigade to more than 20 years in prison for allegedly killing civilians in the city of Mariupol in Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast, Russia's Investigative Committee announced on June 9 on Telegram.

Russia has held a number of sham trials with Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) over the past years, focusing in particular on Azov fighters captured during the war. Azov has been demonized by Russian propaganda for years.

Russian authorities accuse sniper Ruslan Orlov and paramedic Artem Novikov of shooting three civilians in Mariupol in April 2022. The Russian court sentenced Orlov to 26 years in a strict regime colony, and Novikov to 24 years.

Ukraine has not yet commented on the Russian Investigative Committee's statement.

Russia's months-long siege of Mariupol between February and May 2022 reduced the port city to a landscape of rubble and killed thousands.

In the meantime, the Azovstal Steel Plant in Mariupol became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance at the onset of the all-out war, as Ukrainian soldiers valiantly defended the plant under the Russian siege.

On May 16, 2022, Azovstal defenders were ordered to surrender to the encircling Russian forces after nearly two months of constant bombardment of the besieged plant.

The evacuation from Azovstal ended on May 20, 2022, with Ukrainian soldiers transferred to a penal colony in Russian-occupied Olenivka, Donetsk Oblast, now infamous as the site of the mass killing of Azov fighters.

On July 28, an explosion killed 54 Ukrainian prisoners of war and injured over 150 at the Olenivka penal colony. Many of them were members of Azov.

While hundreds of Azov fighters have been released since 2022, hundreds more remain in captivity.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2084791204.jpg

As the war in Ukraine grinds on, attention remains fixed on the battlefield. But Russia’s most vulnerable flank is not in the trenches — it’s in the treasury. The West, and especially the United States, holds economic levers that could push Vladimir Putin toward serious negotiations or even collapse his ability to sustain the war altogether.

Recent developments signal a shift in Washington’s posture. Military aid to Ukraine has resumed, and a landmark U.S.-Ukraine resource agreement was signed on April 30.

More significantly, senators — led by Republican Lindsey Graham — are advocating sanctions that would impose 500% tariffs on Russian oil and commodity exports. Moscow has reacted with alarm, calling this initiative a “counteroffensive from the American deep state.” It’s no bluff. The Kremlin is right to be worried.

What truly threatens Putin’s war machine is energy revenue — or rather, the loss of it. The Russian economy is deeply dependent on oil and gas exports, with the 2025 federal budget based on an oil price of $70 per barrel. But Russian Urals crude is now priced around $60, and could fall further. Saudi Arabia, frustrated by non-compliance within OPEC+, is allowing oil prices to drop, potentially triggering a price war. Riyadh has openly stated it can withstand a prolonged period of low prices — a veiled threat aimed at Moscow and other OPEC+ defectors.

The effects are already visible. Russia has slashed its oil revenue forecast for 2025 by 24%, with the Finance Ministry predicting a drop from 11 trillion to 8.3 trillion rubles. The country’s oil production could decline by up to 50% by 2030, largely because newer reserves are technically difficult and capital-intensive to extract. That’s why Moscow is quietly seeking Western — specifically U.S. — expertise to develop these fields. A coordinated, firm sanctions regime from Washington and Brussels could shut that door completely.

Simultaneously, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are deepening their energy partnership, particularly in liquefied natural gas (LNG). Saudi Aramco has reportedly signed memoranda of understanding with American LNG exporters like NextDecade and Sempra. The latter already holds a major supply contract with Poland’s Orlen, and the U.S. is now poised to become a key alternative gas supplier to Central and Eastern Europe. These investments will expand global LNG capacity and bring prices closer to the U.S. Henry Hub benchmark — lowering Europe’s dependence on Russian gas.

Poland and Ukraine are moving to capitalize on this trend.

Warsaw has announced plans for a second floating LNG terminal, which could eventually supply Slovakia and Hungary — two nations historically reliant on Russian gas. Ukraine, meanwhile, is gaining investor interest now that the U.S. has committed to a joint Reconstruction and Investment Fund, funded through future resource extraction projects. For the first time since the full-scale invasion began, Western business sees a path forward in Ukraine's energy sector.

The implications for Russia are grave. Military spending has ballooned to 6.3% of GDP — its highest level since the Cold War — while the budget deficit continues to rise. To fund its war, the Kremlin is raiding reserves, raising taxes, and cutting social programs. Absent war spending, Russia might already be in recession. The regime increasingly relies on military conflict to justify domestic hardship and consolidate power.

But the geopolitical landscape is shifting. The combination of low oil prices, expanding LNG competition, and targeted U.S. sanctions could inflict sustained economic damage on Russia without risking American or European lives. Energy diplomacy, not just weaponry, could determine the outcome of this war.

The next steps are critical. The White House must maintain pressure — not just by providing Ukraine with military aid, but by deepening its energy cooperation with allies and enforcing robust sanctions. The message to Moscow should be clear: the price of continuing the war will be economic asphyxiation.

If the United States can coordinate its economic tools with allies in Europe and the Middle East, Russia may find itself unable to afford the very war it insists on waging.

A former head of one of the key departments in the Logistics Forces of Ukraine's Armed Forces is suspected of illicit enrichment worth Hr 12 million ($290,000) and illegal possession of weapons, the State Investigation Bureau (DBR) and the National Agency on Corruption Prevention announced on June 9.

Ukraine's military has seen several corruption scandals since the start of Russia's full-scale war, related to illicit enrichment, money laundering, bribery, and misconduct of the command.

The agencies did not disclose the suspect's name, who faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.

During 2023-2024, the ex-head of the department purchased 14 land plots in Kyiv Oblast, an apartment, a Toyota Tundra, a Skoda Octavia, a Hyundai Tucson, and domestic government bonds issued by Ukraine's Finance Ministry, according to the National Agency on Corruption Prevention.

Meanwhile, the suspect and his family had no financial means to purchase these assets, the agency's statement reads.

While searching the suspect's house, law enforcement officers also found weapons and ammunition stored illegally.

The preventative measures for the suspect are now being considered.

The week continues with key developments following peace talks in Istanbul. Russia had said it was ready to begin a major prisoner exchange with Ukraine on June 7–9, involving about 1,200 people per side. Ukraine expected the first group of 500 POWs to be returned over the weekend. The exchange is set to proceed in stages as coordination between the sides continues. However, in recent days, the Russians have accused the Ukrainians of disrupting the process, casting doubt on the prospects for a successful transfer.

Meanwhile, the EU is expected to decide whether to add Russia to its anti-money laundering grey list (a move delayed this week for procedural reasons). The listing would increase scrutiny on Russian transactions and signal stronger financial pressure. While the EU list usually follows FATF guidance, some lawmakers urge Brussels to go beyond it and assess real-world enforcement. The EU is also preparing its 18th sanctions package against Russia, aiming to expand penalties on banks, energy exports, and war-supporting entities.

On Monday, London will host the first Trump-Xi summit of Donald Trump’s second term. The meeting will focus on trade, Indo-Pacific security, and critical minerals however it is likely to be a key meeting for Ukraine. Trump has avoided criticism of Xi for supporting Russia during its invasion of Ukraine unlike other G7 members. But with Putin’s war machine increasingly dependent on China, this outcome of conversation will likely be very important for Ukraine’s future.

As for the U.S., all eyes are on whether the Senate will advance a major bipartisan Russia sanctions bill after Donald Trump requested a delay in the vote. The bill proposes a 500% tariff on imports from countries still buying Russian oil and raw materials, aiming to increase pressure on Moscow and deter indirect support. With 82 senators and House Speaker Mike Johnson backing it, the vote was expected this week, but now faces uncertainty as Trump cites hopes for a possible peace deal. Recent reports suggest that Trump has in private pressed the Senate to water down the legislation.

In related U.S. news, Donald Trump will celebrate his 79th birthday on June 14, coinciding with Flag Day and the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary. A massive military parade featuring 6,600 soldiers, vehicles, flyovers, and fireworks is planned in Washington, with Trump expected to attend key moments including an enlistment ceremony. Nationwide protests are also planned that day, with organizers calling it a “day of defiance.”

At the end of next week, the G7 Summit will start in Kananaskis, Canada (June 15–17). Ukraine and Canada have agreed on a joint action plan and Ukraine’s key priorities for the summit. This will be the first G7 meeting for Canada’s new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, and for U.S. President Donald Trump following his return to office. The discussions will focus on support for Ukraine, strengthening bilateral relations, and global issues such as economic stability and climate change.

Ukraine has confirmed its invitation to the NATO summit in The Hague on June 24–25, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Consultations are ongoing about Ukraine’s participation after his recent meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. The Netherlands has welcomed Zelensky’s attendance, following earlier speculation that Ukraine might be excluded.

A new member of Parliament is expected to take office soon following the resignation of Iryna Kolisnyk. A member of the Sluha Narody party, Kolisnyk stepped down after being formally charged with submitting false information in her financial declaration. The next candidate in the party's list likely to enter Parliament is Roman Kravets, administrator of the well-known Telegram channel “Joker,” which is reportedly linked to the President’s Office.

Editor's note: The story was updated with a comment from Ukraine's Air Force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat.

Ukraine's Air Force said on June 9 that it intercepted a total of 479 Russian drones and missiles during a record-high wave of strikes overnight.

According to the official statement, Russia launched 499 weapons, including 479 Shahed‑type attack drones and various decoy drones, four Kh‑47M2 ""Kinzhal"" air-launched ballistic missiles, 10 Kh‑101 cruise missiles, three Kh‑22 cruise missiles over the Black Sea, two Kh‑31P anti‑radar missiles, and one Kh‑35 cruise missile from occupied Crimea.

Ukraine had reportedly neutralized 479 of the incoming targets, with 292 were shot down, and 187 jammed or lost via electronic warfare.

The main target of the Russian attack was one of Ukraine's airfields, Ukraine's Air Force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat said on national television, without specifying the location or the strike's impact on the facility.

The spokesperson called the June 9 attack ""one of the largest that Russia has launched against Ukraine in recent times"" and praised the Ukrainian air defense.

""Of course, there are also hits. We won't specify in which locations, but with the number of missiles and drones that Russia is launching, it is impossible to shoot down everything,"" Ihnat added.

In Kyiv Oblast, air‑raid sirens lasted over ten hours, according to Governor Mykola Kalashnyk. Air defences shot down Russian drones. No civilian casualties were reported. Two houses, a car, and an outbuilding in Boryspil district were reportedly damaged.

In Rivne Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Koval described the night as very heavy. One civilian was reportedly injured. The attack, according to Koval, was the largest since the beginning of Russia's full-scale war.

In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, one person was injured, according to Governor Ivan Fedorov. Over the day, 498 strikes reportedly struck 14 populated areas.

In Kherson Oblast, numerous towns were hit by drones, artillery, and airstrikes. Three apartment blocks, 13 houses, a farm, and vehicles were damaged. Four civilians were injured, the governor said.

In Kharkiv Oblast, nine villages were hit. Seven civilians suffered minor injuries, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. Russian forces reportedly used 22 unguided aviation rockets, 18 guided bombs (KAB), 6 Geran (Shahed) drones, 4 unspecified UAVs, and 1 Molniya drone. Civil damage included houses, a store, a camp, and vehicles.

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Ukrainian defences downed six UAVs at night, Governor Serhii Lysak said. A farm, houses, and vehicles in the region were reportedly hit.

In Sumy Oblast, Russian forces launched nearly 90 strikes across 35 settlements, injuring nine civilians, local authorities reported. Shops, a school, homes, and cars were reportedly damaged. Authorities evacuated 21 people.

In Cherkasy Oblast, air defences shot down 33 Russian drones overnight. No injuries were reported, but falling debris damaged four houses, a farm outbuilding, and a car in the Cherkasy district.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/IMAGE-2025-06-09-11-18-02.jpg

In recent years, the Kremlin has sought to cast Russia as a bastion of so-called traditional values, positioning itself in stark contrast to what it describes as the morally decaying West. Yet beneath this veneer, a more complex reality persists. As exiled Russian philosopher Alexey Zhavoronkov told the Kyiv Independent, “conservative rhetoric and concepts are employed to mask a different reality.”

Within the framework of traditional conservative thought, personal liberty is regarded as a foundational principle. But in today’s Russia, such freedom is markedly absent.

As Zhavoronkov observes, those advancing the narrative of a “conservative” Russia frequently do so less out of ideological conviction than opportunism — aligning themselves with the Kremlin to serve as de facto spokespeople for President Vladimir Putin’s regime while also enriching themselves.

Among those frequently cited as intellectual architects of the Kremlin’s “traditional values” worldview is Alexander Dugin, referred to in Western media as “Putin’s brain” — a title that belies the ambiguous and likely overstated nature of his actual influence.

Dugin, who has openly called for the genocide of Ukrainians and maintains a network aimed at exporting his ideology far and wide abroad, presents himself as a philosopher. But as exiled Zhavoronkov explained to the Kyiv Independent, Dugin's work is marred by intellectual incoherence and lacks the philosophical depth required for serious consideration.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

The Kyiv Independent: Some right-wing contingents in the West claim that Russia is a last holdout for “traditional values.” Could you go into more detail about the image that Russia is trying to project versus what is really happening there?

Alexey Zhavoronkov: This concept of “traditional values” — and by that I mean the political use of the concept of traditional values — is very illustrative because there are hundreds of its interpretations in different documents and publications. If we look at official documents like Russian national development strategies, which offer lists of specific “traditional values,” most of these values are not strictly conservative. We see notions like individual freedom, or we see something more associated with the philosophy of enlightenment (like the idea of human dignity) — meaning that traditional values are more along the lines of liberal thought. There are also certain concepts, such as collectivism, that were carried over from the Soviet period.

Conservative values mentioned in Russian official documents are mostly centered around ‘traditional family’ — beyond that, there isn’t much. This serves as a good example of how conservative rhetoric and concepts — sometimes even borrowed from Western traditions, which are officially condemned in Russia — are employed to mask a different reality.

If we look at the conservative tradition in the U.S. and compare it to the Russian tradition, the differences are striking — they’re two entirely different worlds.

The Kyiv Independent: How so?

Alexey Zhavoronkov: The differences exist on many levels, including political practice. But if we start with the theoretical side, the Anglo-American conservative tradition has a long and deep history. It doesn’t begin as a reaction to the French Revolution (in the 18th century), but rather can be traced back to 15th- and 16th-century England. There’s a lot to examine when analyzing this tradition.

There was no major rupture in the American conservative tradition after World War II. In contrast, the Bolshevik Revolution (in 1917) in Russia effectively severed the continuity of the country’s conservative tradition. In the U.S., there have certainly been political crises within the conservative movement, but the development of the tradition was never interrupted. Moreover, in the U.S., after World War II, much of the conservative movement was defined by anti-communism. Overall, if we look at major themes and the political policies associated with them, there’s very little overlap between the Russian and American traditions.

Russia sees itself as having a unique role in the world — it believes it should save the world, but it will save it by means of destruction.

The Russian tradition faced multiple issues that differentiated it from the American tradition — which itself had internal problems, such as the split between neoconservatives and paleoconservatives since the 1970s. I’ll return to that later, because I think there are some similarities between American and Russian neoconservatives, though only at the level of the international political agenda.

As I mentioned, in Russia, we see a major interruption in the conservative tradition. There was certainly a conservative tradition before the revolution, though by the end of the 19th century, it was already in decline. It’s also quite telling that as soon as the Russian (imperial) government, under Emperor Alexander III, officially adopted conservative rhetoric, conservatism as an intellectual movement practically disappeared. The government wasn’t interested in serious programmatic works; it only needed slogans, which were mostly supplied by the official press.

There were a plethora of newspapers and some journals that labeled themselves as conservative, but there were virtually no intellectual platforms for Russian conservatives. The golden era of Russian conservatism — associated with the Slavophile movement in the mid-19th century — was already long gone. It wasn’t revived later under Emperor Nicholas II, and then came the revolution. After that, there were only limited attempts to revitalize the conservative tradition during the Soviet period, by figures like Alexander Solzhenitsyn, for instance. There were also some more radical conservative, mostly Orthodox, movements during the Soviet period. But aside from a few collections of essays and Solzhenitsyn’s publications, there were no major works that could be considered significant intellectual manifestos. So we are left to piece together fragments from various texts — texts that are neither philosophical in nature nor structured as political programs.

I think the last truly meaningful intellectual exchange between Russian conservatives and Russian liberals was the debate between Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov in the 1970s and 1980s. Both of them had clearly defined (but incompatible) visions of Russia’s future.

Many aspects of that debate are either no longer relevant or problematic, such as Solzhenitsyn’s idea of the nation. But still, it was a genuine (direct and indirect) debate that highlighted fundamental differences in how each thinker envisioned Russia’s path forward over the coming century.

The Kyiv Independent: Why do you think the Russian government following the USSR’s collapse, chose the path of neoconservatism?

Alexey Zhavoronkov: I think if we return to the issue of tradition, it’s clear that there has been a break in its continuity. Contrary to what the Russian government suggests, this tradition has not been restored. Instead, the government is attempting something similar to what American anti-traditionalist neoconservatives aimed to do starting in the 1980s — namely, to formulate a global political agenda based primarily on the country's national interests rather than on international agreements and rules. These national interests are used to justify what I would describe as aggressive, even imperialist, policies aimed at establishing or maintaining dominance in various regions of the world.

Of course, the economic weight of a country like the U.S. is incomparably greater than that of Russia. Russia represents only a small fraction of the global economy and is now largely isolated from many international markets. Therefore, the Russian government had to come up with a different kind of justification for its imperial ambitions.

This justification has taken on a radical Orthodox form. This is where figures like Alexander Dugin come into play, along with many other ideologists who popularized the concept of “Katechon” — which has become one of the key notions in Russian politics today.

The Kyiv Independent: Could you explain what that is?

Alexey Zhavoronkov: This concept enforces the idea that Russia is the world’s sole and last protector against the Antichrist. Instead of American political and economic exceptionalism, which is manifested in (U.S. President Donald) Trump’s policies, Russia has its own form of exceptionalism, but with different pillars supporting the ideology. For the U.S., the pillar is economic dominance, as seen in Trump’s obsession with tariffs. For Russia, the pillar is spiritual or radical Orthodoxy, which contains strong elements of messianism. Russia sees itself as having a unique role in the world — it believes it should save the world, but it will save it by means of destruction. And to protect the world, Russia must be in a constant state of war with those who worship the Antichrist, namely with the ‘Collective West.’

The so-called ‘Collective West’ is another political concept actively used in Russian politics. The permanent state of war also means a permanent state of exception within Russia, because war serves as a perfect justification for almost any political action. In such a situation, established rules no longer apply. The government can always claim that it’s an exceptional circumstance.

The Kyiv Independent: You mentioned Alexander Dugin. Could you just go into who he is and how he came into prominence? In the West, they call him “Putin's brain.” But his connections to Putin are highly debated. Does he have any real influence in Russia or is it just an outward projection?

Alexey Zhavoronkov: Yes, Dugin is a really interesting figure from the perspective of how he's seen from the West. For a long time — even in Western political science — he was widely regarded as Putin’s favored ideologist, someone with direct access to him and the ability to advise him on key issues. This was, of course, not the case. And this still isn't the case today, although Dugin has gained significantly more favor in recent years for various reasons, one of which is the murder of his daughter.

I think Dugin is perhaps the most eclectic ideologist in Russia as of today. What he writes is mostly eclectic and situational commentary on what the Russian government does. At the heart of his “philosophy” is the so-called Fourth Political Theory, a framework intended to create a new political ideology to replace existing ones such as Liberalism and Marxism. This idea is understandable on an elementary level, but there is no intellectual content in this theory. It consists only of slogans about the need to establish such a theory, without offering any clear explanation of what that theory should actually be. It's also evident that Dugin has no intention of developing it further, and neither do other ideological figures in Russia, largely due to the nature of Russian politics.

Contemporary Russian politics — much like during the reign of Emperor Alexander III — has no need for intellectual manifestos. The role of ideologists is largely to retroactively justify actions already taken. Their task is to claim, for example, that they have long supported a particular policy or alliance, referencing something they wrote in a book a decade ago.

The Russian government uses the strategy of fusionism. It has encompassed pretty much all movements that existed around it. Nowadays, we have Marxists and Stalinists who support Putin, but also traditionalists like Dugin, fascists, etc. This is a wild mix of people from diverse backgrounds who, in theory, should hold differing opinions — but in practice, they do not, at least not publicly. Many of them even collaborate within government-affiliated organizations, such as the Izborsky Club (a Russian think tank which Dugin is a member of, among others).

What we see in Russia is an eclectic blend of very different ideologies, all loosely labeled as conservatism. To better disguise this inconsistency, Putin — or more accurately, his speechwriters — occasionally reference conservative literature, sometimes even theories by Western authors.

Take, for example, Putin’s speech from October 2021 — just a few months before the war began. In it, there’s a noteworthy section where he offers a clear definition of conservatism. Interestingly, this definition closely aligns with liberal conservatism as understood by scholars like Michael Freeden and others. Conservatism, in this context, is portrayed as cautious progress based on principles of healthy realism and anti-isolationism, a framework of cultural relations that emphasizes respect for different traditions and viewpoints, aversion to extremism, etc.

All the rhetoric about cautious decision-making, anti-isolationism, and respect for others stood in stark contrast to what unfolded just a few months later. It’s clear that Putin aims to appeal to the more conservative segments of the Russian population — and indeed, many Russians hold culturally conservative views in their everyday lives. But ultimately, this conservative messaging serves to mask policies that are, in many respects, deeply anti-conservative.

This is why I would label it as pseudo-conservatism — it mimics conservatism with the clear goal of making people feel more secure in turbulent times and fostering pride in their nation and government. However, in practice, what’s actually happening has little to do with traditional conservatism.

The Kyiv Independent: We see from here in Ukraine why people like Dugin are so dangerous. He has actively called for the genocide of Ukrainian people for years — that's what got him kicked out of one university back in 2014 or 2015, if I'm not mistaken. But what damage has he and others like him inflicted upon Russian academia over the past decade of war? What damage can they inflict abroad?

Alexey Zhavoronkov: It's a really good question. I think Dugin's academic trajectory shows us that nowadays, the Russian government is seriously concerned with the issue of Russian academics not being too cooperative, for the most part.

There’s a set of statistics from 2022 that breaks down how different social groups relate to the war, whether they support it actively, passively, or oppose it altogether. The group with the least support for the war was Russian academics, which signals to the government that this is a significant issue.

The government uses various means to control the excessively ‘cosmopolitan’ Russian academia. We see now that pro-government ideologists have been gifted their own institutes. Dugin now directs the Ivan Ilyin Higher Political School, an institute within the Russian State University for Humanities. This, along with other recent policies in education, is a signal to Dugin’s colleagues from the same university and other institutions that they are now being closely watched. Naturally, this contributes to an atmosphere of paranoia and self-censorship.

This self-censorship did not start in 2022. We do not have hard statistical data, but we still have some facts from recent history, like the dissolution of the Department for Constitutional Law at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow directly after the public debate concerning the necessity of the 2020 amendments to the Russian constitution. This action was not the government’s initiative. The university itself decided to lay off leading scholars in constitutional law, de facto, because there was no living constitution anymore. The constitution was amended in a way that several parts of it were practically destroyed.

People like Dugin contribute to the deterioration of the overall intellectual climate and the rise of self-censorship, which, I believe, is even worse than state censorship. In today’s Russia, state censorship is more about punishing a few individuals, while the universities punish the other 200 people themselves out of fear. It's different from the Soviet Union, where state control was stricter and all-encompassing.

Externally, Dugin makes an impression, partly because he has an army of writers, translators, and many supporters promoting his books in Europe and the U.S. I know several colleagues here in Germany, for instance, who were excited that there was supposed to be a workshop on Dugin’s philosophy at the Danube Institute in Hungary and wanted to attend. However, after watching some of his videos, they started questioning what he was actually saying. They realized it wasn’t philosophy but more like justificatory commentary on the Russian political agenda, filled with big slogans trying to align him with current policies. For instance, in his talk with John Mearsheimer, Dugin explicitly states that Ukraine should have been either neutral or part of Russia, and now Eastern Europe should be either neutral or ""ours.""

Dugin gives the impression, externally, that he represents Russian philosophy today and embodies the intellectual majority among his colleagues, which is not the case. However, he is the loudest, with all the necessary resources and instruments at his disposal. While he presents himself as a traditionalist, he also uses capitalist tools to commercialize his ideas in the West, adapting his views depending on where he is. In this way, he reminds me of Trump a bit.

If we look at some of the translations of Dugin’s books, like the German or English versions, it’s striking how much he tailors his message to please his European audience. In Russia, he often speaks of the ‘collective West’ or Europe as a declining culture, a culture that promotes degeneration. But for his German audience, he or his ghostwriters prepared an introduction to one of his major works that says something like this: “Germany has historically been oppressed by the U.S., but I, Dugin, am fond of German culture and thinkers.” Indeed, his Russian publications frequently reference Hegel and Heidegger, although he never understands their ideas. However, for his Russian audience, he also emphasizes the need for authoritarianism or even totalitarianism. When appealing to a German audience, he avoids such statements, knowing they wouldn't resonate with his readers there. Instead, he tries to appeal to a broader public, not just the most radical circles, by presenting himself as a German sympathizer.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Ukraine has begun a large prisoner exchange with Russia as part of a deal reached during recent peace talks in Istanbul, President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed on June 9.

""Ukrainians are coming home from Russian captivity,"" Zelensky said in a statement. ""Today the exchange began and will continue in several stages over the coming days. Among those being returned now are wounded and severely wounded prisoners, as well as those under 25.""

The swap marks the first stage of the agreement negotiated at the second round of direct Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul on June 2.

The Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said the first group of released prisoners includes personnel from Ukraine's Navy, Ground Forces, Air Force, National Guard, Border Guard Service, Territorial Defense, and State Special Transport Service.

Among those freed are defenders of Mariupol who had spent more than three years in captivity. All those returned in this stage are enlisted and noncommissioned soldiers, officials said.

""Most of those returned were captured in the first days of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022,” Ukraine's Human Rights Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said.

Lubinets said his office monitored the exchange on the ground to ensure respect for human rights under the Geneva Convention and helped freed Ukrainians contact their families.

""We warmly welcome all who can now breathe the air of their homeland after years of captivity,"" Lubinets said. ""Our team shares in the joy of the families who received that precious and long-awaited call.""

The ongoing exchange covers specific categories — soldiers under 25, the severely wounded, and seriously ill prisoners — and Ukraine continues to work to repatriate the bodies of fallen servicemembers, according to the General Staff.

Ukrainian officials did not disclose the total number of POWs freed on June 9, citing security reasons. Ahead of the exchange, Zelensky had said Ukraine aimed to bring home 500 prisoners in the June 7-8 swap, which ultimately did not take place as scheduled.

June 9 swap comes after Kyiv denied Russian claims that it had delayed the planned June 7-8 exchange. Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky had accused Ukraine of postponing the swap indefinitely. Ukrainian officials dismissed this as disinformation.

""Unfortunately, the Ukrainian side is once again facing (Russian) attempts to retroactively revise agreements. If the Russian side is now backing away from what was promised in Istanbul, it raises serious questions about the reliability and capability of their negotiating team,"" Ukraine's Defense Ministry wrote on Telegram.

In his June 8 address, Zelensky accused Russia of playing a ""dirty political and information game"" and reiterated that Kyiv had not received a full list of POWs from Moscow, as negotiated in Istanbul.

Since March 2022, Ukraine has brought home more than 5,000 prisoners through exchanges. Kyiv continues to press Russia to agree to an ""all-for-all"" swap — a proposal Moscow has so far rejected.

The Istanbul talks, hosted by Turkish officials, resulted in the largest planned prisoner exchange of the war, though broader progress toward a peace deal remains elusive.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/IMAGE-2025-06-09-14-57-31.jpg

Russian forces are conducting their offensive in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk Oblast as part of efforts to create a ""buffer zone"" on Ukrainian territory, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on June 9, according to Russian state-controlled media.

Peskov's comments allude to Russia's claims that neighboring Ukrainian Donetsk Oblast belongs to Moscow. The claim is based on Russia's proclaimed annexation of the region in September 2022.

Kremlin spokesperson comments follow weeks of renewed Russian advances in Donetsk Oblast and President Vladimir Putin's May 22 statement that Moscow is working to establish a ""security buffer zone"" along Ukraine's borders with Kursk, Bryansk, and Belgorod oblasts.

Ukrainian officials denied Russia's latest claims of progress in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.

""As of the morning of June 9, all Russian information, including Peskov's statements, about an offensive in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast does not correspond to reality,” said Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation.

Operational Command South reported on June 8 that Russian troops are continuing attempts to break into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast but described the situation as ""tense"" rather than indicating any successful advance.

The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on June 8 that its forces had entered Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Ukrainian officials immediately rejected the assertion.

Viktor Trehubov, spokesperson for Ukraine's Khortytsia group of forces, also called the reports false, telling CNN that Russian forces had not advanced from the Pokrovsk or Novopavlivka directions, where the three oblasts of Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Dnipropetrovsk converge.

Since 2014, Russian aggression has heavily impacted Donetsk Oblast, while Dnipropetrovsk Oblast has remained free from confirmed ground incursions. Ukraine rejected similar Russian claims in May, when officials debunked allegedly fabricated photos purportedly showing Russian troops in the region.

Despite this, Dnipropetrovsk has faced frequent Russian missile and drone attacks throughout the full-scale war. The region began mandatory evacuations from four front-line villages in April as a precaution.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1407293337.jpg

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte called on alliance members to deliver a ""quantum leap"" in defense investment as the threat from Russia persists, Bloomberg reported on June 9.

""Danger will not disappear even when the war in Ukraine ends,"" Rutte said in prepared remarks for a speech at Chatham House in London. ""We must have more forces and capabilities to implement our defense plans in full.""

Rutte urged NATO members to boost air and missile defense by 400%, citing lessons from Russia's attacks on Ukraine.

Russia has been repeatedly targeting Ukrainian cities with missiles and drones of different types. Most recently, on June 9, Russia launched 499 drones and missiles during its massive overnight attack across Ukraine.

Kyiv has been consistently calling on its allies to boost air defense support.

""We see in Ukraine how Russia delivers terror from above, so we will strengthen the shield that protects our skies,"" Rutte said, according to Bloomberg.

Rutte is pushing for NATO countries to adopt a new military spending target of 3.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2032, alongside an additional 1.5% of GDP for security-related projects such as cyber defense and border control. The proposal comes after U.S. President Donald Trump called on allies to spend 5% of GDP on defense.

Rutte's remarks follow his earlier warning during an April visit to the White House, where he met with Trump. There, he reiterated that NATO views Russia as a ""long-term threat"" to Euro-Atlantic security.

""We all agree, in NATO, that Russia is the long-term threat to NATO territory, to the whole of the Euro-Atlantic territory,"" Rutte said after those talks.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2184023227.jpg

Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

A Ukrainian drone attack struck the JSC VNIIR-Progress facility in the Russian city of Cheboksary in the Chuvashia Republic, causing explosions and massive fires, Russian Telegram news channels reported in the early hours of June 9.

The General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces confirmed the strike, saying Ukrainian drone units, in coordination with other units, targeted VNIIR-Progress and ABS Electro in Cheboksary overnight as part of efforts to degrade Russia's capacity to produce air attack systems.

The targeted facilities are part of Russia's military-industrial complex and produce adaptive Kometa antennas, used in Shahed-type attack drones, planning and correction modules for guided aerial bombs (KAB), and other precision-guided weapons, the General Staff said.

The Ukrainian military confirmed that at least two drones struck the site, causing a large fire. The results of the strike are still being assessed.

VNIIR-Progress is a Russian state institute that specializes in developing electronic warfare (EW) systems, including the Kometa antenna, used to jam satellite, radio, and radar signals. The facility has been sanctioned by the U.S. and the EU.

Oleg Nikolayev, the head of the Chuvashia Republic, claimed that two drones ""fell"" on the premises of the VNIIR-Progress facility on June 9.

The ""responsible decision was made to temporarily suspend production to ensure the safety of employees,"" he said.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims.

In video footage from local residents purporting to show the attack on the facility, smoke and flames can be seen rising over the city of Cheboksary. One video, published by the Russian independent news outlet Astra, shows a drone approaching the target and making impact, causing another explosion.

VNIIR-Progress is a major research and development institute for Russian EW systems. It produces the Kometa antenna, which Russia uses to make its bombs more accurate and less vulnerable to Ukrainian interference.

The strike marks the second reported Ukrainian drone attack against Russia's Chuvashia Repbulic.

Ukraine reportedly attacked the Burevestnik oil refinery in Cheboksary on March 9, in its first reported drone strike in the region. The refinery lies over 900 kilometers (559 miles) from the Ukrainian border.

In recent days, Ukraine has launched a number of strikes against military facilities in Russia, including missile bases and airfields. The most audacious and high-profile attack came on June 1, when Ukraine carried out Operation Spiderweb — a mass drone strike that simultaneously targeted four major Russian air bases, reportedly damaging 41 planes.

The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on June 9 that air defense units had intercepted 49 Ukrainian drones throughout the country.

A Ukrainian strike allegedly damaged two Russian military aircraft — a MiG-31 and either a Su-30 or Su-34 fighter jet — at an airfield used to launch Kinzhal missile attacks, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on May 9.

The extent of the damage is still being assessed, the military said.

Ukraine's overnight strike targeted the Savasleyka airfield in Russia's Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, which the Kremlin uses to launch MiG-31K jets armed with Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, according to the General Staff.

The operation was conducted by Ukrainian Special Operations Forces in coordination with other units.

The strike happened as Russia launched a massive attack on Ukrainian cities overnight on June 9.

Recently, Ukraine has stepped up strikes on Russian military aircraft, which Moscow often uses to target civilian infrastructure. Earlier this month, Ukrainian drones destroyed dozens of Russian strategic bombers and surveillance aircraft in a series of attacks dubbed Operation Spiderweb.

On June 1, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) used smuggled first-person-view drones to strike four Russian airfields: Olenya, Ivanovo, Dyagilevo, and Belaya. The SBU said 41 aircraft were damaged or destroyed, including heavy bombers and rare A-50 spy planes, causing an estimated $7 billion in damage.

Footage of those strikes, released by Ukrainian officials on June 4, showed direct hits on key Russian aircraft.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has approved a new naval strategy aimed at fully restoring Russia's position as a leading global maritime power, Kremlin aide Nikolai Patrushev said in an interview with the Russian state-controlled Argumenty i Fakty newspaper.

Patrushev, a former KGB officer, told the Russian newspaper that the new document, titled The Strategy for the Development of the Russian Navy up to 2050, was approved in late May.

""Russia's position as one of the world's greatest maritime powers is gradually recovering,"" Patrushev said. He added that such work requires a long-term vision of future maritime challenges and threats.

Patrushev provided no further details on the new naval strategy

Russia currently operates the world's third most powerful navy, according to most public rankings, behind China and the United States. However, the fleet has suffered a string of losses during the war against Ukraine, particularly in the Black Sea.

Since September 2022, Ukraine has used naval kamikaze drones to target the Russian Black Sea Fleet, destroying several vessels. The latest strike sank a Mangust-class patrol boat off the coast of occupied Crimea using a domestically produced Magura drone.

Ukraine's campaign has drawn on the Jeune École naval doctrine, leveraging small, low-cost drones against larger warships. After losing its conventional surface fleet early in the war, Ukraine turned to developing its own naval drones.

The approach has proven effective.

In April 2022, Ukraine sank the Moskva, the fleet's flagship, with Neptune missiles. It has since struck key naval bases and reportedly disabled or destroyed around a third of Russia's Black Sea Fleet. The General Staff said in June that 29 Russian vessels had been taken out of action.

In response, Russia began pulling back ships from occupied Crimea to the port of Novorossiysk in late 2024 to shield them from further attacks. The redeployment limited Moscow's ability to blockade Ukrainian grain exports, though Russian naval capabilities in other regions remain largely intact.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/40376926_2181642765411801_4095442172197732352_n.jpg

Russia launched another large-scale attack against Ukraine overnight on June 9, assailing cities across the country with drones and missiles.

At least one person was reported injured in Rivne, a city far from the front lines in northwestern Ukraine.

The mass strike comes shortly after Russia on June 6 launched 452 drones and 45 missiles at Ukraine in a single night — one of the largest aerial attacks in the full-scale war. The Kremlin claimed the bombardment was retaliation for Kyiv's Operation Spiderweb drone strike on Russian strategic aircraft.

Ukraine's Air Force issued aerial alerts throughout the night on June 8-9, warning multiple regions of the threat of ballistic missiles and Shahed-type attack drones.

The Operational Command of the Polish Armed Forces said it scrambled fighter jets in response to the Russian aerial attacks in western Ukraine.

Explosions were reported during the night in Kyiv and Rivne.

Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, reported that an office building in the capital's Darnytsia district had been damaged in the attack.

One civilian in Rivne was injured in the attack, regional Governor Oleksandr Koval said. Emergency responders are still at work on the scene and the consequences of the strike are still being determined.

""A very difficult night for Rivne Oblast. Our region suffered a powerful enemy air strike,"" Koval said.

Rivne is located in northwestern Ukraine and shares a border with Belarus. Like neighboring Volyn Oblast, which was hit in Russia's mass strike on June 6, the region is not a frequent target of Russian aerial attacks

Reuters reported on June 8 that the U.S. expects Russia to launch more large-scale, multi-pronged strikes at Ukraine in the coming days as part of Moscow's ""asymmetrical"" response to Operation Spiderweb.

The Kremlin's retaliation could target high-value government sites, such as administrative buildings or intelligence facilities, a Western diplomatic source said.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on June 1 carried out an audacious mass drone attack on four key Russian air bases, reportedly damaging 41 military planes, including the heavy bombers Moscow uses to carry out attacks on Ukrainian cities.

The operation took 18 months to plan and execute, and allegedly caused $7 billion of damage to Russia's aerial fleet.

Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly warned U.S. President Donald Trump during a June 5 phone call that Moscow was preparing a response to the operation. That night, Russia's mass strikes injured 80 people and killed four civilians, including emergency workers.

Trump said the next day that Operation Spiderweb ""gave Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them last night.""

Ukraine's Operation Spiderweb exclusively targeted military facilities — specifically, the aircraft used to bomb civilian targets in Ukraine. The strike followed three years of aerial attacks and three months of Russian refusal to accept a ceasefire.

In the days leading up to the June 1 operation, Russia launched three heavy aerial attacks against Ukraine over three consecutive nights.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected the idea that Russia's attacks are a response to Operation Spiderweb. Following a night and day of relentless bombings in the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Zelensky on June 7 said Russia's strikes were ""not 'retaliation' but acts of destruction.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2147853376-2.jpg

Unified heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk invited U.S. President Donald Trump to live for a week in his house in Ukraine during a June 8 interview with BBC Sport.

Trump has pledged to negotiate an end to Russia's war against Ukraine, but after six months in office a ceasefire remains nowhere in sight. Trump has threatened to abandon the peace process altogether and even suggested Ukraine is to blame for Russia's intensifying aerial attacks.

Usyk said he would welcome Trump to visit his home in Ukraine to experience the realities of the war firsthand.

""I advise American President Donald Trump, go to Ukraine and live in my house one week. Only one week ... Watch what's going on every night,"" he told BBC Sport.

""Every night, bombs fly above my house. Bomb, rocket, Shahed. Every night.""

Usyk's appeal to Trump comes after multiple large-scale Russian attacks against Ukrainian cities.

Originally from Crimea, Usyk now resides in Kyiv, the target of several drone and missile strikes in late May and early June. Russia has broken its nightly drone record repeatedly in the last two weeks and U.S. officials have warned Ukraine to expect more mass strikes in the coming days.

While Trump initially criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin after a series of consecutive attacks against Ukrainian cities in late May, he did not follow through on threats to sanction Moscow.

Trump has since attempted to delay and soften a U.S. Senate bill imposing harsher sanctions against Russia and has even threatened to possibly sanction Ukraine.

Usyk has previously directed public comments to Trump while advocating for Ukraine. During the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Usyk took to social media to urge Trump to use his purported influence over Putin to help free Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs).

Usyk has held the title of unified heavyweight champion since 2021. Before his professional boxing career, he was a gold medalist at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/GettyImages-2212584890.jpg

Vladyslav Horai, a renowned tenor and soloist of the Odesa National Opera, was killed in Ukraine’s northeastern Sumy Oblast while on a volunteer mission, the opera house reported on June 8.

""A tragic loss has shaken the entire Ukrainian arts community,"" the Odesa National Opera wrote in a Facebook post. ""Today, June 8, while carrying out his volunteer mission in the Sumy region, the soloist of the Odesa National Opera, a world-class tenor, volunteer, father, a man of great heart, and Honored Artist of Ukraine — Vladyslav Horai — was killed.""

Horai was widely known both in Ukraine and internationally for his voice and stage presence, according to his colleagues. ""Vladyslav was not just a talent of the stage — he was an example of strength, dignity, and kindness in life,"" the opera house said.

Horai had been a member of the opera troupe at the Odesa National Academic Theater of Opera and Ballet since 1993. He was a laureate of the National Chamber Music Competition in Khmelnytskyi and the International Antonín Dvořák Vocal Competition in Karlovy Vary, Czechia, and was awarded the title of Honored Artist of Ukraine in 2013.

French automaker Renault will begin manufacturing drones in Ukraine, France Info reported, marking a significant collaboration between the automotive and defense sectors. Renault will partner with a small French defense company to equip production lines on Ukrainian territory, with the drones expected to serve both Ukrainian and French military forces.

While the French Defense Ministry declined to comment on Renault specifically, Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu confirmed on June 6 that a major French car manufacturer would join forces with a defense SME to launch drone production in Ukraine. Speaking to Le Monde, Lecornu did not name the automaker, but praised the project as an ""unprecedented partnership.""

When contacted by France Info, Renault confirmed that it has been contacted by the government, but added that ""no decision has been taken at this stage.""

The production will take place away from front-line areas, although the exact locations were not disclosed. Lecornu emphasized that the assembly would be handled by Ukrainians, citing their strong expertise in drone development and combat deployment strategies.

Lecornu also said there is ""no need"" to send French citizens to work on the production line, since it will be set up in Ukraine, where Ukrainians ""are better than us at designing drones and especially at developing the strategies that accompany them.""

This move underscores France’s growing support for Ukraine’s defense industry and comes as Ukraine continues to expand its own drone manufacturing capabilities.

Presidential advisor Oleksandr Kamyshin said in March that Ukrainian producers have the capacity to make over 5 million FPV drones annually.

Drone warfare has become a central component of the ongoing war, with both Ukraine and Russia increasingly relying on unmanned systems for reconnaissance and strikes.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/GettyImages-2215792667.jpg

There are currently no plans for mass civilian evacuations from the city of Sumy, regional Governor Oleh Hryhorov said on June 8, as Russian advances into Sumy Oblast have continued to gain momentum.

""There are currently no grounds for evacuation from the city of Sumy. The situation along the Sumy Oblast border is tense but under control of the Defense Forces,"" Hryhorov said on social media, referencing concerns on social media from residents.

Sumy Oblast has seen escalating attacks in recent weeks as Russia intensifies cross-border operations. Russian advances into Sumy have gained momentum since Ukrainian forces withdrew from most of their foothold in Russia's Kursk Oblast in March.

Sumy Oblast, which borders Russia to the north, has been a repeated target of Russian incursions and shelling since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022.

Sumy has repeatedly suffered from Russian strikes on the city. On June 3, Russian attacks on the city killed four people and injured 28 others, including three children.

On May 31, Hryhorov announced mandatory evacuation orders for 11 more villages due to intensifying attacks, bringing the total number of evacuated settlements in Sumy Oblast to 213.

The open-source battlefield monitoring group DeepState reported on June 8 that Russian forces have occupied the village of Loknia in Sumy Oblast, as the advances on small settlements along the border continues. Ukraine's military has not yet commented on the reported advance, and the Kyiv Independent cannot independently verify the reporting.

In May, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his military to create a so-called ""security buffer zone"" along the border with Ukraine, while President Volodymyr Zelensky said on May 28 that Moscow had massed 50,000 troops near Sumy.

Key developments on June 7-8:

US expects Russia's retaliation for Operation Spiderweb to continue soon

Ukraine denies Russian troop presence in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast amid offensive, describes situation as 'tense'

Trump administration redirects 20,000 anti-drone missiles meant for Ukraine, Zelensky confirms

'I am against Ukraine's entry into the European Union,' Polish president-elect Nawrocki says

The U.S. believes Russia has not yet fully responded to Ukraine's Operation Spiderweb and may soon launch another large-scale, multi-pronged strike following the massive June 6 attack, Reuters reported on June 8, citing unnamed U.S. officials.

One official told Reuters that, while the timing remains unclear, a retaliatory strike could be expected in the coming days and is likely to be ""asymmetrical."" Another U.S. source said Russia would likely employ missiles and drones to hit a combination of targets.

The U.S. assessment follows the June 1 attack by Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) on four Russian air bases using drones launched from trucks concealed within Russian territory.

Kyiv's operation reportedly damaged 41 aircraft, including Tu-95 and Tu-22M3 bombers — two of Russia's primary platforms for missile attacks against Ukraine.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the number of aircraft hit. At least 21 planes were damaged or destroyed, according to open-source intelligence analysts.

A Western diplomatic source told the outlet that the Kremlin's response could focus on high-value government sites, such as administrative buildings or intelligence facilities.

Michael Kofman, a military analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, suggested Moscow may aim medium-range ballistic missiles at headquarters belonging to the SBU, which organized the operation.

On June 6, Russia launched one of its most intense aerial barrages of the full-scale war, firing 452 drones and 45 missiles at Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, according to the Air Force. The attack was likely part of Russia's response to Operation Spiderweb.

At least four civilians were killed, including emergency service workers, and 80 others were injured in the overnight assault, President Volodymyr Zelensky reported.

The June 6 strikes followed a phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump on June 4, during which Putin reportedly vowed to retaliate against the Ukrainian drone operation.

U.S. officials say Moscow's June 6 barrage may not be the full extent of its response. Russia has carried out near-nightly air assaults in recent weeks, several of which predated Spiderweb, making it difficult to separate a targeted reprisal from Russia's ongoing campaign of attrition.

Shortly after the June 6 Russian attack, Trump seemed to justify the aggression against Ukrainian cities that was launched in response to Ukraine's Operation Spiderweb.

""They gave Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them last night,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on June 6.

Ukraine denies Russian troop presence in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast amid offensive, describes situation as 'tense'

Russian forces continue their efforts to break into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Ukraine's Southern Defense Forces reported on June 8, saying that the situation around the 31st Separate Brigade's positions remains ""tense.""

""The enemy has not abandoned its plans to enter Dnipropetrovsk Oblast,"" the Southern Defense Forces wrote on Telegram. ""Our soldiers are bravely and professionally holding their section of the front, thwarting the occupier's plans.""

The comment follows the Russian Defense Ministry's June 8 claim that its forces had entered Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.

Despite the claims, Major Andrii Kovalev, a spokesperson for Ukraine's General Staff denied Russian troop presence in the region.

""The information is not true. Fighting is ongoing in Donetsk Oblast. The enemy did not enter Dnipropetrovsk Oblast,"" Kovalev told Ukrainska Pravda.

In a separate statement to CNN, Viktor Trehubov, a spokesperson for for Ukraine's Khortytsia group of forces said that ""the Russians are constantly spreading false information that they have entered the Dnipropetrovsk region from the Pokrovsk and Novopavlivka directions, but (in neither place) is this information true.”

The 31st Brigade is deployed in the Novopavlivka direction, where Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts converge. Since 2014, Russian aggression has heavily impacted Donetsk Oblast, while Dnipropetrovsk Oblast has remained free from direct incursions.

The denials from Ukraine's militaary come amid continuing Russian offensives in eastern and northern Ukraine, along with escalating diplomatic efforts that have yet to yield a ceasefire.

President Volodymyr Zelensky's Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa said on June 6 that Russia aims to occupy all Ukrainian territory east of the Dnipro River and advance toward Odesa and Mykolaiv in a broader plan to sever Ukraine's access to the Black Sea, amid a renewed summer offensive.

On May 21, Ukrainian officials rejected similar claims that Russian troops had reached Dnipropetrovsk Oblast's administrative boundary.

Serhii Lysak, head of the regional military administration, called the reports ""fake,"" citing doctored photos allegedly showing Russian soldiers in the area.

The Ukrainian monitoring project DeepState analyzed one such image and determined it had been taken in Troitske, a village in Donetsk Oblast.

As a precaution, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast began mandatory evacuations of children and families from four front-line villages in late April — Kolona Mezhova, Novopidhorodne, Raipole, and Sukhareva Balka — located just 5 to 15 kilometers from Russian positions.

Despite the lack of verified ground incursions, Dnipropetrovsk has endured frequent Russian missile, drone, and aerial attacks since the full-scale invasion began.

The ongoing Russian advance occurs as peace efforts remain stalled, and U.S.-brokered negotiations have failed to achieve a ceasefire.

Trump administration redirects 20,000 anti-drone missiles meant for Ukraine, Zelensky confirms

Zelensky confirmed that Trump's administration diverted 20,000 anti-drone missiles originally intended for Ukraine to American forces in the Middle East, in an interview with ABC News published on June 8.

Zelensky said Ukraine had counted on the missiles to help counter relentless Russian drone attacks, which include swarms of Iranian-designed Shahed-type drones. On June 1, Russia launched a record 472 drones in a single night.

""We have big problems with Shaheds… we will find all the tools to destroy them,"" Zelensky said. ""We counted on this project — 20,000 missiles. Anti-Shahed missiles. It was not expensive, but it's a special technology.""

Zelensky said the plan had been agreed upon with then-U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and was launched under President Joe Biden's administration.

The Wall Street Journal reported on June 4 that the Trump administration had redirected the munitions, which include special fuzes used in advanced rocket systems to intercept drones, toward U.S. forces stationed in the Middle East.

The Pentagon reportedly informed Congress in a classified message that the reallocation of the fuzes for the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System was deemed an ""urgent issue"" by current Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

A Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) source told the Kyiv Independent on June 4 that Russia is preparing to launch more than 500 long-range drones per night in future attacks, as Moscow rapidly scales up drone production and constructs new launch sites.

The Trump administration has halted the approval of new military aid packages to Ukraine since the start of his second term in January.

Ukraine downs fighter jet in Russia's Kursk Oblast, Air Force says

Ukraine shot down a Russian Su-35 fighter jet in Russia's Kursk Oblast on the morning of June 7, the Air Force reported.

Although no details of the operation were disclosed, the downing brings the total number of Russian aircraft destroyed since the start of the full-scale invasion to 414, according to Ukraine's General Staff.

Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign forces since World War II.

Reinforced by North Korean troops, Russia launched a push to recapture the region in early March, with Ukraine being forced to pull back from much of the initially taken territory, including the town of Sudzha.

The downing of the Su-35 fighter jet also adds to the losses Ukraine has inflicted on the Russian Air Force over the past week during Operation Spiderweb.

'I am against Ukraine's entry into the European Union,' Polish president-elect Nawrocki says

""At the moment, I am against Ukraine's entry into the European Union,"" Polish President-elect Karol Nawrocki told Hungarian outlet Mandiner in an interview released on June 7.

""On the one hand, we must support Ukraine in its conflict with the Russian Federation, but Ukraine must understand that other countries, including Poland, Hungary, and other European countries, also have their own interests,"" he said.

Nawrocki won the second round of the Polish presidential election on June 1 with 50.89% of the vote. He has previously voiced opposition to Ukraine's membership in the EU and NATO, despite supporting Ukraine's sovereignty.

""Poland has such an interest, for example, in the exhumation of the Volyn (massacre) victims,"" Nawrocki said.

Polish and Ukrainian researchers began exhuming victims of the World War II era massacres on April 24 in Western Ukraine.

It was the first such exhumation since 2017, when Ukraine imposed a moratorium in response to the destruction of Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) memorials in Poland.

""During the campaign, I did not agree, and as president, I will not agree, to unfair competition with Ukraine for Polish agriculture or the logistics sector,"" Nawrocki said.

EU tariffs on Ukrainian agricultural exports resumed on June 6, amid opposition to Ukrainian exports and its EU accession from eastern European members, including Hungary and Poland.

""I see Ukraine as a country that, although it is very bravely defending itself against the Russian Federation, must also respect the interests of other countries that otherwise support Ukraine,"" he said.

In contrast to other Eurosceptic leaders in Europe, including Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Nawrocki does not express pro-Russian views, but has repeatedly accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of taking advantage of allies.

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said on June 8 that Slovakia will block EU sanctions against Russia if they are deemed to harm the country's national interests.

""If there is a sanction that would harm us, I will never vote for it,"" Fico told reporters.

Fico's comments come as Slovakia’s parliament passed a resolution on June 5 urging the government to oppose any new international sanctions or trade restrictions against Russia, citing alleged negative economic impacts.

The non-binding resolution argues that the sanctions imposed in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine have driven up energy prices, disrupted supply chains, and harmed Slovak industry.

The resolution calls on government ministers to “defend national economic interests” in international forums and resist further punitive measures targeting Moscow.

Since taking office in 2023, Fico has reversed Slovakia's previous pro-Ukraine policy, ending military aid to Kyiv and questioning the value of EU sanctions on Russia.

EU foreign policy decisions, including sanctions, require unanimous approval by all member states. A Slovak veto could force concessions or delay enforcement in future rounds.

Unlike Ukraine-skeptic Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban who has repeatedly obstructed and delayed the bloc's sanctions against Russia and military aid for Ukraine, Slovakia has not previously attempted to block EU sanctions.

""I am interested in being a constructive player in the European Union, but not at the expense of Slovakia,"" Fico said, without elaborating on how he will vote on any upcoming EU sanctions packages.

Fico added that he would not support any measure that halts Russian fuel imports that are used to power Slovakia's nuclear power plants.

Discussions are underway as the EU is preparing an 18th sanctions package against Russia. EU ambassadors on May 14 agreed on the bloc's 17th package of sanctions against Russia, primarily targeting its shadow fleet of oil tankers.

Ukraine's European allies are tightening sanctions against Russia as Moscow refuses to cease fire. Despite Russia's refusal, no new U.S. sanctions have been imposed so far.

Editor's note: This article has been updated to reflect comments made by President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Ukraine has denied Russian claims that it had delayed a planned exchange of prisoners of war (POWs) and the bodies of fallen soldiers, reportedly scheduled for June 7-8.

Ukrainian and Russian delegations agreed to conduct a major swap, which would include severely injured prisoners and young people aged 18 to 25, during their second round of direct peace talks in Istanbul on June 2.

After the talks, Russia also pledged to transfer 6,000 bodies of fallen Ukrainian soldiers and officers to Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that preparations for exchanging the bodies would begin after the POW swap.

On June 7, however, Vladimir Medinsky, head of the Russian delegation in peace talks, claimed that the contact group of the Russian Defense Ministry was reportedly stationed at the border with Ukraine, but the Ukrainian side ""unexpectedly postponed both the transfer of bodies and the POW exchange indefinitely.""

Ukraine's Defense Ministry dismissed the claim as false, saying it was an attempt by Russia to avoid returning Ukrainian POWs from captivity and take their POWs back to Russia.

""Unfortunately, the Ukrainian side is once again facing attempts to retroactively revise agreements. If the Russian side is now backing away from what was promised in Istanbul, it raises serious questions about the reliability and capability of their negotiating team,"" the ministry wrote on Telegram.

Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of POWs also refuted Russia's claim, saying that ""instead of constructive dialogue, Ukraine once again faced manipulations and attempts to exploit sensitive humanitarian issues for information purposes.""

In his evening address on June 8, President Volodymyr Zelensky said: ""as always, in its spirit, (Russia) is trying to play some kind of dirty political and information game with these issues,"" adding that Kyiv has not received a full list from Moscow of the POWs planned to be exchanged

According to the headquarters, Ukraine submitted lists of POWs ""formed according to clearly defined categories agreed upon during the negotiations in Istanbul,"" while the Russian side ""provided different lists that do not correspond to the agreed approach.""

The headquarters also added that an agreement on the repatriation of bodies of fallen soldiers was made, but the date was not set.

""Instead of consistently implementing the agreed procedure, the Russian side took unilateral actions that were not coordinated within the joint process,"" the statement reads.

""Unfortunately, instead of constructive dialogue, we are once again faced with manipulations and attempts to exploit sensitive humanitarian issues for information purposes. We remain committed to a real outcome — the return of our prisoners and the bodies of the fallen — and are ready to continue working within the agreed framework.""

The latest direct Russia-Ukraine talks, hosted by Turkish officials, followed the first round of negotiations on May 16. The initial meeting ended with an agreement on the largest prisoner exchange of the war, but without any tangible progress toward a peace deal.

Ukraine has returned over 5,000 prisoners via exchanges with Russia since March 2022, according to officials. Kyiv has repeatedly pressed Moscow to agree to an ""all-for-all"" prisoner exchange, but Russia has rejected the proposal.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/qwdqwdqwdqwdqwdqwd-1.jpg

Germany is planning to quickly expand it network of air raid shelters and bunkers, in preparation for a potential Russian attack on the country, Ralph Tiesler, the head of the Germany's Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance said.

""For a long time, there was a widespread belief in Germany that war was not a scenario for which we needed to prepare. That has changed. We are concerned about the risk of a major war of aggression in Europe,"" Tiesler told the German Suddeutsche Zeitung news outlet on June 5.

Tiesler, the official in charge of civilian protection in Germany, said that only 580 of the country's 2,000 cold war-era bunkers were in working order. In its current condition, the shelters would house 480,000 people, a small fraction of the country's population that total 83 million people.

""We must quickly create space for 1 million people,"" Tiesler said. ""Existing structures must be assessed and adapted without delay,"" warning that solely constructing new shelters would take too long.

The focus on revamping shelters comes amid ongoing fears that Russia may attack a NATO country within the next decade.

Germany's Defense Chief Carsten Breuer told BBC on June 1 that allies need to be prepared for an attack within the next four years.

""There's an intent and there's a build up of the stocks,"" Breuer said. ""This is what the analysts are assessing - in 2029. So we have to be ready by 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that's not earlier than 2029? I would say no, it's not. So we must be able to fight tonight.""

Breuer's comments were the latest in a series of increasingly dire warnings from Western leaders and defense officials about the threat emanating from Russia and Europe's current lack of preparedness.

Tiesler said that Germany would need to spend at least 10 billion euros ($11.4 billion) to cover civil defense needs over the next four years, and 30 billion euros ($34 billion) over the next 10 years. Tiesler's office is expected to produce a detailed plan to the shelters' expansion, as well as addition civil defense needs this summer.

As concerns as to where Russia may launch an initial incursion into NATO territory mount, Russia has continued to restructure its military presence along its Baltic flank. Analysts and military experts believe that Russia may launch on initial attack on a country in the Baltic Sea region, given its strategic positioning and surroundings, including the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1239424490.jpg

Zelensky said the plan had been agreed upon with then-U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and was launched under President Joe Biden's administration.

The Wall Street Journal reported on June 4 that the Trump administration had redirected the munitions, which include special fuzes used in advanced rocket systems to intercept drones, toward U.S. forces stationed in the Middle East.

The Pentagon reportedly informed Congress in a classified message that the reallocation of the fuzes for the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System was deemed an ""urgent issue"" by current Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

A Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) source told the Kyiv Independent on June 4 that Russia is preparing to launch more than 500 long-range drones per night in future attacks, as Moscow rapidly scales up drone production and constructs new launch sites.

The Trump administration has halted the approval of new military aid packages to Ukraine since the start of his second term in January.

Trump has repeatedly expressed skepticism about continued assistance to Kyiv and temporarily suspended military shipments earlier this year, only resuming them after Ukraine agreed to a ceasefire framework during peace talks in Jeddah on March 11.

Hegseth, who ordered the temporary halt, did not attend the most recent Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting on June 4 — the first such absence by a U.S. defense chief since the beginning of the full-scale invasion.

Ukraine has urgently called on Western partners to expand investments in domestic arms production and deliver more air defense systems, including U.S.-made Patriots, to counter intensifying Russian airstrikes.

Despite growing international appeals and Kyiv's offer of a 30-day ceasefire as the basis for peace talks, Moscow continues to reject the proposal.

The exchange of the bodies of deceased soldiers, agreed upon during Ukraine-Russia negotiations in Istanbul on June 2, is scheduled for next week, Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine’s military intelligence chief (HUR), said on June 8.

""The start of repatriation measures following the negotiations in Istanbul is scheduled for next week, as authorized persons were informed on Tuesday (June 3),"" Budanov posted on Telegram.

Budanov's statement comes just a day after Russia claimed that a prisoner swap had failed due to Ukraine's fault — an accusation Kyiv denied.

Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (POW) said on June 7 that preparations for the exchange of bodies were underway, although no specific date had been confirmed.

Budanov condemned Russian propaganda efforts surrounding the matter.

""The attempts of some Russian propagandists to capitalize on human suffering, which they themselves are responsible for, sound particularly cynical,"" he said. ""Especially on the great feast of Pentecost, which we are celebrating today.""

On June 7, Russian media published a video showing refrigerators allegedly containing the bodies of fallen Ukrainian soldiers, claiming they had been delivered for exchange.

POW Coordination Headquarters deputy head Andrii Yusov told Ukrainian Pravda that the footage had been filmed inside Russia and not at a designated exchange site.

According to Budanov, Ukraine continues to honor the terms agreed during the June 2 Istanbul talks despite mounting Russian information pressure and attempts to impose unilateral conditions.

At the Istanbul meeting, both sides agreed to a new round of prisoner exchanges involving severely wounded personnel and individuals aged 18 to 25.

Russia also pledged to hand over 6,000 bodies of deceased Ukrainian soldiers and officers. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on June 4 that the repatriation would follow the next POW swap.

The June 2 negotiations marked the second direct peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, after an earlier session on May 16. While no ceasefire or political settlement was reached, both rounds led to agreements on humanitarian measures.

Ukraine and Russia carried out the largest prisoner swap of the full-scale war from May 23 to 25, exchanging 1,000 captives each.

Ukraine has repeatedly urged Moscow to adopt an ""all-for-all"" prisoner exchange formula. While over 5,000 Ukrainians have been returned from Russian captivity since March 2022, Russia continues to resist a comprehensive swap.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2037956412.jpg

Errol Musk, the father of U.S. billionaire Elon Musk, has arrived in Moscow to attend the Forum of the Future 2050, a pro-Kremlin event scheduled for June 9-10, the Russian newspaper Kommersant reported on June 8.

The report comes amid a high-profile public conflict between Elon Musk, the world’s wealthiest businessman, and his former ally, U.S. President Donald Trump. In May, Musk announced he would step down as an advisor to Trump and as the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency. Since then, he has emerged as a major critic of the president.

The pro-Kremlin event will be hosted by the Tsargrad Institute and led by far-right Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin.

""I am eager to meet everyone. As far as I know, Russians are among the most intelligent people on the planet. It would be foolish not to ask their opinion on all sorts of issues,"" Errol Musk was quoted as saying by the Russian state news agency TASS.

Among the forum's panels are sessions titled ""Russian Space: The Race for Mars"" and ""The Battle for Hearts and Minds: The Ideology of Sovereign Russia.""

According to Kommersant, scheduled speakers include Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, oligarch Konstantin Malofeev, and prominent state TV anchor Ekaterina Andreeva.

Errol Musk, a former South African businessman and politician, has publicly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him ""a strong leader"" and saying that ""it would be foolish not to admire Putin"" in an April interview with BBC Russia.

Errol's attendance at the far-right event comes amid growing scrutiny of his son, Elon Musk, whose role as the head of SpaceX and the Starlink satellite network places him at the center of both U.S. defense operations and Ukraine's battlefield communications.

SpaceX holds billions in Pentagon and NASA contracts, including a $1.8-billion agreement with the U.S. intelligence community to build a classified spy satellite system.

Despite initially aiding Ukraine by providing Starlink terminals to stabilize battlefield communications, Elon Musk has increasingly echoed Kremlin-aligned narratives.

He has suggested that President Volodymyr Zelensky lacks public support in Ukraine and has repeatedly called U.S. aid a driver of a ""never-ending draft meat grinder.""

Those statements have been warmly received by Russian officials, military bloggers, and state media outlets, which have praised Musk as a voice of reason and a critic of Western involvement in the war.

Dmitry Novikov, deputy chairman of the Russian parliament's international affairs committee, said on June 6 that Moscow is ready to grant political asylum to Musk following his public dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/GettyImages-1241046930.jpg

The U.S. believes Russia has not yet fully responded to Ukraine's Operation Spiderweb and may soon launch another large-scale, multi-pronged strike following the massive June 6 attack, Reuters reported on June 8, citing unnamed U.S. officials.

One official told Reuters that, while the timing remains unclear, a retaliatory strike could be expected in the coming days and is likely to be ""asymmetrical."" Another U.S. source said Russia would likely employ missiles and drones to hit a combination of targets.

The U.S. assessment follows the June 1 attack by Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) on four Russian air bases using drones launched from trucks concealed within Russian territory.

Kyiv's operation reportedly damaged 41 aircraft, including Tu-95 and Tu-22M3 bombers — two of Russia's primary platforms for missile attacks against Ukraine.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the number of aircraft hit. At least 21 planes were damaged or destroyed, according to open-source intelligence analysts.

A Western diplomatic source told the outlet that the Kremlin's response could focus on high-value government sites, such as administrative buildings or intelligence facilities.

Michael Kofman, a military analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, suggested Moscow may aim medium-range ballistic missiles at headquarters belonging to the SBU, which organized the operation.

On June 6, Russia launched one of its most intense aerial barrages of the full-scale war, firing 452 drones and 45 missiles at Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, according to the Air Force. The attack was likely part of Russia's response to Operation Spiderweb.

At least four civilians were killed, including emergency service workers, and 80 others were injured in the overnight assault, President Volodymyr Zelensky reported.

The June 6 strikes followed a phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump on June 4, during which Putin reportedly vowed to retaliate against the Ukrainian drone operation.

U.S. officials say Moscow's June 6 barrage may not be the full extent of its response. Russia has carried out near-nightly air assaults in recent weeks, several of which predated Spiderweb, making it difficult to separate a targeted reprisal from Russia's ongoing campaign of attrition.

Shortly after the June 6 Russian attack, Trump seemed to justify the aggression against Ukrainian cities that was launched in response to Ukraine's Operation Spiderweb.

Editor's note: This story has been updated to reflect the latest information.

A 46-year-old Ukrainian woman and her 6-year-old daughter were found murdered on June 6 in the city of Leuven, Belgium, authorities reported.

The woman and her daughter were found after first responders were called to the scene of the fire in the community of Haasrode. Both victims were found in the fire and had previously suffered stab wounds, Belgian media outlet VRT reported.

According to Belgian newspaper De Standaard, the 16-year-old son of a Ukrainian woman has confessed to fatally injuring his family and setting their home on fire. The Leven prosecutor's office said the boy admitted to the crimes after five hours of questioning.

The Ukrainian family, which was not named, had been living in Belgium for three years.

VRT reported that the father of the murdered girl is a Ukrainian soldier currently serving on the front line.

No additional details were released as the investigation into the double homicide is ongoing.

A number of Ukrainian citizens have been killed or injured in attacks in multiple European cities, including in hate-motivated attacks.

At least 12 civilians were killed and 65 others injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over the past 24 hours, regional officials reported on June 8.

According to Ukraine's Air Force, Russian forces launched 49 drones overnight, including Iranian-designed Shahed drones, along with an Onyx anti-ship missile and two X-59/69 guided air-launched missiles.

Air defenses intercepted 40 drones, while another 18 dropped off radar — likely decoys intended to overwhelm Ukrainian systems. Strikes were reported in at least five regions.

Six civilians were killed and 44 injured in Kharkiv Oblast, including in the city of Kharkiv and nine surrounding settlements, according to Ukraine's National Police.

Among the victims were two children — a one-and-a-half-month-old infant and a 14-year-old girl — as well as two police officers and a State Emergency Service employee.

In Donetsk Oblast, Russian strikes killed four people — two in Yablunivka, one in Kostyantynivka, and one in Siversk — Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Nine more were injured in ongoing shelling across the front-line region.

In southern Ukraine, one civilian was killed and nine others injured in Kherson Oblast, where Russia struck residential areas and critical infrastructure, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin.

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, one man was killed when Russian forces dropped three guided aerial bombs late on June 7, Governor Serhii Lysak reported.

Two women were injured in Sumy Oblast early on June 8 when a strike drone hit the region. One of the victims is pregnant, local authorities reported.

One additional injury was recorded in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where Russia carried out fresh attacks on settlements, Governor Ivan Fedorov said.

Russian forces have occupied the village of Loknia in Ukraine's Sumy Oblast, the open-source battlefield monitoring group DeepState reported on June 8.

Located roughly 30 kilometers (some 18 miles) north of the city of Sumy, Loknia lies near the Russian border in a strategically exposed area.

While Russia's Defense Ministry claimed control over the village on May 24, DeepState's latest assessment marks the first independent confirmation of the development.

Ukraine's General Staff has not yet commented on the matter.

Sumy Oblast, which borders Russia and three other Ukrainian oblasts — Chernihiv, Poltava, and Kharkiv — has seen escalating attacks in recent weeks as Russia intensifies cross-border operations.

Russian advances into Sumy have gained momentum since Ukrainian forces withdrew from most of their foothold in Russia's Kursk Oblast in March.

In May Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his military to create a so-called ""security buffer zone"" along the border with Ukraine, while President Volodymyr Zelensky said on May 28 that Moscow had massed 50,000 troops near Sumy.

Moscow's two major airports temporarily suspended operations early on June 8 due to a wave of Ukrainian drone strikes targeting the Russian capital and its surrounding regions, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin reported on Telegram.

According to Sobyanin, air defense units began intercepting drones flying toward Moscow shortly after 4 a.m. Between 5:59 a.m. and 8:19 a.m., he reported the downing of 10 drones in separate waves.

Each incident was followed by the deployment of emergency services to the crash sites.

The attacks forced authorities to temporarily close Moscow's Vnukovo and Domodedovo airports — two of the city's busiest hubs. Operations were reportedly suspended around 6:53 a.m. local time, disrupting passenger traffic and causing delays.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed that 61 Ukrainian drones were launched between the evening of June 7 and the morning of June 8, targeting Russian territory and occupied Crimea.

The ministry said drones were intercepted over Moscow and its suburbs, as well as in Bryansk, Belgorod, Kaluga, Tula, Oryol, and Kursk oblasts.

Ukraine's military has not yet commented on the attack, and the Kyiv Independent cannot verify information provided by Russian officials.

Kyiv has stepped up its long-range drone campaign against Russia in recent months, particularly targeting Moscow and key military infrastructure. Though most drones are intercepted before reaching the capital, the threat has caused repeated disruptions to civilian air travel.

Since Jan. 1, Ukrainian drone raids have prompted at least 217 temporary airport closures across Russia, according to data from Rosaviatsia, Russia's aviation agency, the independent outlet Novaya Gazeta Europe reported on May 14.

On the nights ahead of Russia's Victory Day on May 9, drone strikes prompted widespread flight restrictions that affected travel plans for more than 60,000 passengers, according to the Association of Russian Tour Operators.

While Ukrainian officials have not publicly commented on the latest attacks, defense officials in Kyiv have consistently described strikes on military and logistical targets inside Russia as legitimate acts of self-defense amid Moscow's ongoing aggression.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1243734669-1.jpg

Russia attacked the city of Kharkiv with KAB guided bombs the evening of June 7, killing a woman and a man and injuring at least 18 people.

The bombing follows a night of deadly Russian strikes against the city. Russia launched drones, missiles, and guided bombs at Kharkiv overnight on June 7, killing at least three people and injuring 19, including two children.

Rescuers were still searching for the bodies of six victims believed to be trapped under the rubble on the afternoon of June 7, according to the regional prosecutor's office.

At around 5:30 p.m. local time, Mayor Ihor Terekhov warned that Kharkiv was again under attack from guided aerial bombs.

Russia launched four KAB bombs at central Kharkiv, targeting the city's Shevchenkivskyi and Kyivskyi districts, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported after the attack. One of the bombs hit the Children's Railway, a popular gathering place for families.

A 30-year-old woman was killed in the attack, Syniehubov said. Another 19 people were injured, with three in serious condition. Ten victims have been hospitalized.

The woman who as killed was an employee of Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia), according to Oleksandr Pertsovskyi, board chair of Ukrzaliznytsia. Four other railway employees were among the injured.

The Children's Railway in Kharkiv was closed at the time of the attack, Pertsovskyi said. The opening had been canceled because of security risks.

The attacks damaged two buildings and four cars at the Children's Railway, two homes, and a farm building, according to Syniehubov. Emergency responders are still at work on the scene.

President Volodymyr Zelensky called the bombing a ""brutal"" attack and offered his condolences to the victims, noting that Russian strikes ""have been hitting our city of Kharkiv all day long.""

Zelensky rejected the idea that Russia's bombardments are a ""response"" to Operation Spiderweb, Ukraine's daring mass drone strike that struck military aircraft at four Russian air bases on June 1. Russia's only aim is destruction, the president said.

""In more than 11 years of Russia’s war against Ukraine, they have brought only one new thing to our land, and this is really the most widespread Russian product — ruins and death.""

The previous night, Russia struck civilian targets across Kharkiv, including an apartment building. The attack killed three and injured 19, including a 1-month-old baby. Extensive search-and-rescue operations were underway following the strike.

The attack on Kharkiv came the night after Russia launched a large-scale drone and missile attack across Ukraine on June 6. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed the strike was a response to Operation Spiderweb — despite Russia's history of mass aerial attacks on civilian targets throughout the full-scale war.

U.S. President Donald Trump echoed the narrative the day after the attack, saying the attack on military aircraft gave Russian President Vladimir Putin ""a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them.""

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on June 7 that Russian forces continued to brutally bomb Kharkiv, targeting the city ""throughout the day"" with both drones and guided aerial bombs. Two people were killed and at least 18 injured following what Zelensky called ""a brutal strike on the city in broad daylight.""

""These Russian strikes are not 'retaliation' but acts of destruction,"" the president added.

On June 6, U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to justify Russia's large-scale attack on Ukrainian cities launched the night before, in response to Ukraine's Operation Spiderweb. He said earlier that Russia's response to Ukraine's Operation Spiderweb is likely ""not going to be pretty.""

""They gave (Russian President Vladimir) Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them last night,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.

Zelensky stressed that Russia’s goal is the complete erasure of life in Ukraine and reiterated that in all occupied territories, Russia has shown its true intent — building only military infrastructure and looting anything of value. ""In more than 11 years of war, Russia has brought only one new thing to our land — ruins and death,"" he said.

Zelensky highlighted Ukraine’s urgent need for air defense and appealed specifically to the United States: ""We still await a response to our proposal to purchase systems that can help. We need concrete signals, not words."" He thanked European countries for their support and underlined the need for joint production of air defense systems and missiles, noting this is essential not only for Ukraine but for all of Europe.

He also renewed calls for increased international pressure, saying that ""no form of pressure on Russia can be eased."" Zelensky warned that Moscow continues to prepare for war and ignores every peace proposal: ""They must be held accountable.""

Reporting on recent military updates, Zelensky said Ukrainian forces destroyed three Russian Iskander missile launchers used to strike Ukrainian communities. He also confirmed the downing of a Su-35 fighter jet, damage to Russian helicopters, and new strikes against Russian military logistics and airfields.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on June 7 released new footage from Operation Spiderweb, Kyiv's daring mass drone strike against four Russian military airfields on June 1.

The video shows the flight path of a first-person-view (FPV) drone from the moment it takes off from the roof of a modular building to the moment it strikes a Russian Tu-22M3 strategic bomber at the Belaya air base in Siberia.

The drone flies a considerable distance from its launch point to the airfield, where smoke is already rising from planes struck earlier in the operation. The video shows a previously hit Russian aircraft engulfed in flames.

Russia's Belaya air base in Irkutsk Oblast, southeastern, Siberia, is located over 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) from Ukraine.

Operation Spiderweb involved smuggling FPV drones deep into Russian territory, according to the SBU. The drones were hidden in mobile wooden cabins on trucks and remotely launched at the right moment to strike bombers used in missile attacks on Ukrainian cities.

The operation took 18 months to plan and execute.

The SBU said the strikes disabled 34% of Russia's cruise missile bombers and inflicted approximately $7 billion in damage.

The Belaya air base was among the most distant targets. Other bases included the Olenya (Murmansk Oblast), Diaghilev (Ryazan Oblast), and Ivanovo (Ivanovo Oblast) air bases.

Ukraine said the strike succeeded in damaging 41 planes, including Tu-95 and Tu-22M3 bombers and rare A-50 spy planes. The Kyiv Independent could not independently confirm the number of planes allegedly damaged or destroyed, though open-source intelligence analysts have confirmed that at least 21 aircraft were damaged or destroyed.

Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, a growing debate has emerged over the cultural and political legacy of Russian literature — particularly the global reverence for classic Russian authors, which critics argue has long served to promote the imperial narratives embedded in their work.

As Ukrainian author Oksana Zabuzhko wrote in the Times Literary Supplement in 2022, their works of literature are “the camouflage net” for Russian tanks in Ukraine.

Among the most famous classic Russian authors is 19th-century Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821–1881). More than a century after his death, Dostoevsky remains a dominant figure in the world literary canon, his name recognized even by those who have never read his work.

This April, Penguin Books reissued an English-language edition of his “The Dream of a Ridiculous Man,” while his “White Nights” continues to enjoy popularity among online literary communities.

Defenders of Dostoevsky maintain that his writing transcends politics, focusing on existential and psychological themes. They argue that interpreting his work through a nationalist or imperialist lens oversimplifies the complexity of his ideas.

But many scholars and commentators point to Dostoevsky’s spiritual vision of Russia’s destiny — a vision that portrays the country as a moral, unifying force against a “decaying” West that was, at the time, heading toward the Gilded Age. They draw parallels between this worldview and that of contemporary Russian ideologues like Alexander Dugin, who frame Russian aggression in near-religious terms.

As the war continues, it remains to be seen whether Russia’s literary past can be disentangled from its politics.

Rather than calling for a boycott of Russian authors, the Kyiv Independent wants to raise a more illuminating question: Why do so few English-language readers know the Ukrainian authors who were the contemporaries of Dostoevsky?

The lack of global recognition for Ukraine’s classic writers is not coincidental. It reflects a legacy of imperial domination, during which the Russian Empire frequently suppressed the Ukrainian language and culture, the same empire that Dostoevsky often praised in his writings.

Some of the most influential voices in the history of Ukrainian literature were active during the same period as Dostoevsky. Others who came just before him, like Mykola Gogol, are known worldwide but have long been misclassified as “Russian.” Literary figures such as Lesia Ukrainka and Ivan Franko, who came to the literary scene just after Dostoevsky’s time, are now reemerging in English translation — their essential works poised to resonate with a global audience, just as they once did across the European intellectual landscape.

Although there is no evidence that Dostoevsky knew his Ukrainian contemporaries, they did interact with some other famous Russian authors. Below is a brief overview of three Ukrainian authors of the 19th century and the themes that shaped their work.

The purpose of this list is not to outright dismiss Russian literature, but rather to remind people of the selective nature of the global literary canon, and to draw attention to the Ukrainian voices that have long been overlooked or marginalized.

Taras Shevchenko (1814 - 1861)

Born a serf, Ukrainian national icon Taras Shevchenko gained his freedom thanks to his artistic talent. But liberation did not end his struggle — instead, it sharpened his focus on the plight of his people under Russian imperial rule. A pioneer of ethnographic art and literature, Shevchenko used both pen and brush to document the everyday lives of Ukrainians, casting a critical eye on their subjugation and the erasure of their culture.

Published in 1840, “Kobzar” is widely regarded as Taras Shevchenko’s defining work. The collection takes its name from traditional Ukrainian musicians who sang of Cossack heroism while playing the kobza, a stringed instrument.

Taras Shevchenko (1814–1861) was the foremost Ukrainian poet, writer, artist, public and political figure, folklorist, and ethnographer of the 19th century. Self-portrait (1843). (Wikimedia)

The poems reflect on the cultural and political struggles of Ukraine under Russian rule. In “To Kvitka-Osnovianenko,” Shevchenko pays tribute to the writer Hryhorii Kvitka-Osnovianenko, an early advocate of Ukrainian as a literary language, and mourns the destruction of the Zaporizhzhian Sich, the Cossacks’ last stronghold, in the 18th century. Another poem, “Kateryna,” tells the story of a young Ukrainian woman seduced and abandoned by a Russian imperial soldier, highlighting the personal toll of imperial domination.

Shevchenko was deeply influenced by ideas of national identity, language, and self-determination — views that drew the ire of the tsarist authorities. He was arrested in 1847 and exiled to military service in a remote part of Kazakhstan. According to historical accounts, Tsar Nicholas I reportedly ordered that Shevchenko be restricted from writing or painting. However, Shevchenko still managed to create art and later returned briefly to Ukraine before his death.

Panteleimon Kulish (1819 - 1897)

Kulish’s politics were somewhat complex, perhaps even contradictory to some. In his early years, he was affiliated with the Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius, a short-lived secret political society that existed between 1845 and 1847. The group championed the federalization of the Russian Empire, a Ukrainian language and culture revival, and the abolition of serfdom, among other initiatives.

Over time, however, Kulish's stance diverged from mainstream Ukrainian thought, particularly as he advocated for the preservation of a distinct Ukrainian culture while simultaneously supporting a political union with Russia.

This position ultimately led to his marginalization in many Ukrainian intellectual circles, both in Russian-controlled Ukraine and the parts of Ukraine under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Despite this, Kulish continues to be respected and read by many Ukrainians today for his literary achievements.

His novel “The Black Council” (1857) is considered the first historical novel in Ukrainian literature. Set against the backdrop of the Ruin — the tumultuous period following the death of Cossack Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi in 1657 — it delves into the power struggles that ensued. The novel draws inspiration from the Black Council of 1663, a pivotal gathering in Nizhyn in modern-day Chernihiv Oblast, where nobles and commoners alike converged to elect a new hetman for left-bank Ukraine.

The novel not only captures the fierce internal conflicts among Cossack leaders but also explores the deep social rifts that defined one of Ukraine’s most fractured and tragic eras. Excerpts of the novel have been translated online. However, a full publication of the book in English translation has yet to materialize.

Marko Vovchock (1833 - 1907)

Among Ukraine’s most talented female writers was Marko Vovchok, whose “Folk Stories” was published in 1857, shortly after the ascension of Tsar Alexander II, initially seen as a reform-minded ruler compared to his father, Nicholas I. However, while the serfs were liberated under his rule in 1861, it could be argued that the liberal period of his rule, at least for Ukrainians, was short-lived: a decree in 1863 banned Ukrainian-language publications, followed by the stricter Ems Ukaz of 1876.

Vovchok’s collection gained even greater significance in this repressive climate. Focused on the suffering of Ukrainian peasants — especially women — under serfdom, the stories were informed by her early work assisting her husband’s ethnographic research. She gathered material directly from villagers, preserving oral traditions.

Russian writer Ivan Turgenev translated the stories into Russian, sparking additional debate in literary circles over the realities of serfdom. Shevchenko is said to have recommended her work to Turgenev, declaring her “the most powerful in our language.”

In the short story “The Cossack Girl” from the collection, Olesia, a free woman, falls in love with a serf and chooses to marry him, ultimately sacrificing her freedom. Her family warns her that marrying a serf will disgrace their village and its Cossack heritage, even suggesting that she might as well “drown herself.” Olesia insists that love is more important than social status. The marriage, however, proves disastrous, with Olesia, her husband, and their children enduring significant hardship. Under empire, happy endings are a rarity — if they exist at all.

Canada will provide Ukraine with over $25.5 million in military equipment, the Canadian Defense Ministry said in a statement on June 6.

The country pledged to provide Ukraine with almost $22 million worth of Coyote and Bison armored vehicles, as well as new equipment and ammunition supplied by Canadian companies.

It adds to Canada’s earlier delivery of 64 Coyote armored vehicles, which were sent to Ukraine in December 2024.

Apart from that, Canada will provide Ukraine with around $3.6 million for electronic warfare anti-jammer kits from Canada’s defence industry, reads the statement.

The decision was announced by Canadian Defense Minister David McGuinty during the 28th meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in the Ramstein format in Brussels on June 6.

“As a founding member of NATO, Canada believes that the alliance is the cornerstone of transatlantic security and we are moving quickly to accelerate our defense spending and increase our contributions to NATO,” McGuinty said, as quoted in the statement.

“During the meeting of NATO defense ministers, Canada reaffirmed unwavering support to Ukraine as its citizens fight for their freedom, and we look forward to working closely with allies to strengthen our collective security.”

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Canada has pledged over $19.5 billion in overall aid to Ukraine, with $4.5 billion allocated for military support, including multi-purpose drones, armored support vehicles, anti-tank weapons, small arms, M777 howitzers with ammunition.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2201099727.jpg

The rescue operation was ongoing as of 1:45 p.m. on June 7, reads the report.

Contact with those trapped has been lost, the prosecutors added.

Russian forces attacked Kharkiv with drones, missiles, and KAB guided bombs overnight on June 7, killing at least three people and injuring 22, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov.

Syniehubov said that drones had struck civilian targets across the city, including a 9-story residential building, a local enterprise, a home, and other facilities.

Two children were injured in the attack, including a 1-month-old baby, Syniehubov said.

At least 40 explosions were recorded across the city amid the attack, local media reported. Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported that the Osnovyanskyi and Kyiv districts of the city suffered strikes.

According to Terekhov, 48 Shahed drones, two missiles, and four guided aerial bombs were launched toward the city.

President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s comparison of Russia’s war against Ukraine to “children fighting in a park” during his interview with ABC News published on June 6.

""We are not kids with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin at the playground in the park,"" Zelensky said, as quoted by the TV network. ""He is a murderer who came to this park to kill the kids.""

The U.S. president, who has repeatedly claimed he alone can bring an end to the war, said on June 5 that it might be best not to intervene in Russia’s war against Ukraine for now.

""Sometimes you see two young children fighting like crazy,” Trump said at a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz at the White House. “They hate each other, and they’re fighting in a park, and you try and pull them apart. They don’t want to be pulled. Sometimes you’re better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart.""

Trump's statement came amid stalled negotiations, rising casualties from Russian drone strikes, and Russia's refusal to make any concessions.

Kyiv has repeatedly urged Russia to accept a Western-backed 30-day ceasefire as the first step toward a broader peace deal — a move that Moscow again rejected during the latest round of negotiations in Istanbul on June 2.

In the interview with ABC News, Zelensky also spoke of the ""limitless"" pain endured by a Ukrainian father who lost his wife and three children in a missile strike.

Zelensky added that Trump ""could not feel fully and understand this pain.""

Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) used exclusively domestically produced drones and did not deploy any equipment from allied stockpiles in its recent attack on Russian heavy bombers, President Volodymyr Zelensky told ABC News in an interview published on June 7.

""I wanted very much to use only what we produce and to have the separation (be) very clear,"" Zelensky said, as quoted by the TV network.

On June 1, Ukraine launched a game-changing drone attack on four Russian military airfields, damaging 41 planes, including heavy bombers and rare A-50 spy planes, now largely known as Operation Spiderweb.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently confirm the number of planes allegedly damaged and destroyed by the SBU. At least 21 planes were damaged or destroyed, according to open-source intelligence analysts.

Kyiv has claimed it had disabled 34% of Russia's strategic bomber fleet in what is seen as one of the most daring operations during the full-scale war.

To do so, Ukraine used one of the cheapest weapons already used on the battlefield — first-person-view (FPV) drones.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has been developing and deploying technological innovations and cutting-edge unmanned systems. Both Ukraine and Russia have increasingly relied on drone warfare, using aerial, naval, and ground-based drones for reconnaissance and combat missions.

In late March, presidential advisor Alexander Kamyshin said in an interview with Radio Khartia that Ukrainian manufacturers have the capacity to produce over 5 million FPV drones per year.

A year-and-a-half in the planning, and reportedly personally overseen by SBU Chief Vasyl Malyuk and Zelensky, Operation Spiderweb was an ""absolutely unique operation,"" according to the president.

According to the SBU, the drones were smuggled into Russia, where they were then hidden on the roofs of wooden cabins, which were then transported by truck to the air bases being targeted.

When they reached their destinations, the roofs were retracted remotely, and the drones simply flew off towards the Russian bombers.

In the interview with ABC News released on June 7, Zelesnky said truck drivers who transported the drones did not know anything about their role in the attack.

Ukraine shot down a Russian Su-35 fighter jet in Russia's Kursk Oblast on the morning of June 7, the Air Force reported.

Although no details of the operation were disclosed, the downing brings the total number of Russian aircraft destroyed since the start of the full-scale invasion to 414, according to Ukraine's General Staff.

Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign forces since World War II.

Reinforced by North Korean troops, Russia launched a push to recapture the region in early March, with Ukraine being forced to pull back from much of the initially taken territory, including the town of Sudzha.

The downing of the Su-35 fighter jet also adds to the losses Ukraine has inflicted on the Russian Air Force over the past week.

On June 1, Ukraine launched its Operation Spiderweb, conducted by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), reportedly hitting 41 Russian bomber planes and other aircraft. According to Kyiv, Ukraine inflicted $7 billion in damage and disabled over a third of Russia's strategic bomber fleet.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently confirm the number of planes allegedly damaged and destroyed by the SBU. At least 21 planes were damaged or destroyed, according to open-source intelligence analysts.

The SBU said 117 drones, launched from concealed trucks positioned across Russian territory, simultaneously struck airfields in at least four regions, including sites thousands of kilometers from the Ukrainian border.

Ukraine also downed 87 Russian combat drones, while 80 drones were neutralized by electronic warfare systems or disappeared from radar, the Air Force said.

Russian airstrikes hit 10 undisclosed locations, while wreckage from downed aerial targets landed in seven more, the Air Force said.

The parliamentary foreign affairs committees of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania issued a joint statement on June 6, affirming their firm support for Ukraine both in its defense against Russia and in its pursuit of EU and NATO membership.

Following their meeting in Lithuania on June 6, the Baltic states reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Ukraine’s EU integration, stating their goal of concluding accession talks and welcoming Ukraine as a full EU member by Jan. 1, 2030.

Ukraine applied for EU membership in 2022 and was granted candidate status within months. Accession talks began in June 2024, with European leaders setting 2030 as a target for Ukraine's potential accession.

Despite broad EU support for Ukraine's accession, Hungary remains a major obstacle. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced on March 7 that his government would conduct an opinion survey on Ukraine's potential EU membership.

In their statement, the Baltic states also urged the 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague to take ""concrete political steps"" toward Ukraine’s membership in the alliance. They argued that Ukraine's NATO accession would “consolidate a just and lasting peace not only in Ukraine but also in all of Europe"" and help uphold the rules-based international order globally.

""Ukraine’s NATO membership would provide a more effective and enduring framework for safeguarding Euro-Atlantic security,"" the statement reads.

Ukraine applied for NATO membership in September 2022, months after the outbreak of the full-scale war. The country has not received a formal invitation, as the 32 members have not reached a consensus.

The statement also reaffirmed the Baltic countries’ pledge to support Ukraine “until its full victory,” and welcomed expanding defense cooperation between Ukraine and like-minded partners.

Russian forces attacked Kharkiv with drones, missiles, and KAB guided bombs overnight on June 7, killing at least three people and injuring 19, officials said.

Regional governor Oleh Syniehubov said that drones had struck civilian targets across the city, including a 9-story residential building, local enterprise, a home, and other facilities.

Emergency crews are currently on-scene, searching for additional victims stuck underneath the rubble.

Two children were injured in the attack, including a 1-month-old baby, Syniehubov said.

At least 40 explosions were recorded across the city amid the attack, local media reported. Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported that the Osnovyanskyi and Kyiv districts of the city suffered strikes.

Editor's Note: This article was updated to reflect reported casualties.

Russia launched a mass missile and drone attack against Ukraine overnight on June 6, targeting the capital, major cities, and the country's far-western regions.

A total of 80 people were injured and seven people killed, including first responders, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

""A cynical Russian strike on ordinary cities. More than 400 drones, more than 40 missiles. ... We need to put pressure on Russia to (accept a ceasefire) and to stop the strikes,"" he said.

The attack comes a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin promised to retaliate against Ukraine for its drone strike against Russian air bases in a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Air raid alerts were activated in all Ukrainian regions, following Russia's latest mass attack. Ukraine's Air Force warned during the night that multiple Russian Tu-95MS strategic bombers had taken flight and likely already launched cruise missiles.

Explosions were reported in Kyiv, Ternopil, Khmelnytskyi Oblast, Lviv, Lutsk, and other cities as drones and missiles targeted all regions of the country.

Ukraine's Air Force reported that Russia launched 452 drones overnight, including Iranian-designed Shahed-type suicide drones, along with 45 missiles of various types.

Air defenses intercepted 199 drones, while another 169 dropped off radars — likely used as decoys to overwhelm Ukrainian systems. Ukrainian forces also intercepted 36 missiles, including the Iskander-M ballistic missile.

""Russia doesn't change its stripes — another massive strike on cities and ordinary life. They targeted almost all of Ukraine — Volyn, Lviv, Ternopil, Kyiv, Sumy, Poltava, Khmelnytskyi, Cherkasy, and Chernihiv regions,"" Zelensky said the morning after the attacks.

""Russia must be held accountable for this. Since the first minute of this war, they have been striking cities and villages to destroy life.""

Kyiv and Central Ukraine

Multiple fires broke out across Kyiv as drones struck residential buildings and other civilian infrastructure. Explosions and falling debris were reported in several districts, including Solomianskyi, Holosiivskyi, Darnytskyi, Dniprovskyi, and Shevchenkivskyi.

Three people were killed overnight, Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported. Ukraine's State Emergency Service later confirmed that the victims were rescue workers responding to the attack.

Another 23 people in Kyiv were injured, including 14 emergency responders. A child was among the injured.

According to Ukraine's largest private energy company, DTEK, 2,167 families on the left bank of Kyiv were left without electricity due to Russian attacks.

A Russian drone struck the 11th floor of a 16-story apartment block in the Solomianskyi district, igniting a fire, the Kyiv City Military Administration reported. Three people were rescued, and the fire has since been extinguished. A fire also broke out at an industrial site in the area.

In the Holosiivskyi district, debris hit a residential building, sparking a blaze and causing yet-to-be-assessed damage. An educational institution was damaged in the attack and falling drone wreckage landed near a gas station, damaging a car.

Another erupted on the 17th floor of a residential high-rise in the Darnytskyi district. Medics were called to the site of the attack.

The administration also reported ""significant damage"" to a gas station in the city's Dniprovskyi district.

The attack damaged tracks and cables on the metro line between the Darnytsia and Livoberezhna stations, causing closures and route disruptions. Repair work is expected to be completed in 24 hours, the administration said.

In Chernihiv, the bodies of two people were recovered in the rubble of an industrial facility, Ukraine's State Emergency Service reported.

Western Ukraine

In the western city of Ternopil, Russia struck infrastructure and industrial facilities with Shahed drones and Kalibr cruise missiles, according to Mayor Serhii Nadal. Part of the city lost electricity.

Eleven people were injured, including five emergency workers.

Ternopil lies hundreds of kilometers from the front line and is not a frequent target of Russian attacks.

Casualties were also reported in Lutsk in northwestern Ukraine amid the mass strike. At least two people were killed and 27 more injured, according to the State Emergency Service.

Ihor Polishchuk, the city's mayor, said that the roof of an apartment building was damaged, as were vehicles, commercial properties, and a government institution. According to the mayor, Russia attacked Lutsk with 15 drones and six missiles.

Lutsk is located in Ukraine's Volyn Oblast, which borders Poland. Russia's overnight attack represents the largest strike against the city since the start of the full-scale war.

Russia's retaliation

Russia's mass attack injured dozens of people and caused destruction across the country.

Ukraine had been bracing for a large-scale assault after the Kremlin threatened revenge for Operation Spiderweb — Ukraine's audacious drone strike that damaged 41 Russian bombers on June 1.

After speaking with Putin over the phone on June 4, Trump warned that the Kremlin was planning a response to Ukraine's strike. While Putin has stayed publicly silent on Ukraine's attack, Trump said Russia's retaliation was ""not going to be pretty.""

The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on the morning of June 6 that the overnight attack was a ""response"" to Operation Spiderweb and alleged that the ""goal of the strike was achieved"" and the ""designated objects were hit.""

But Moscow needs no excuse to bombard Ukraine with drones and missiles, as the mass strikes Russia launched against Ukrainian cities in the days before Spiderweb prove. For three consecutive nights in the last week of May, Russia targeted Ukraine with some of the heaviest aerial attacks since the start of the full-scale war.

Aerial strikes against civilian targets have been a regular feature of Russia's all-out war since February 2022.

The Wagner mercenary group announced on June 6 that it was withdrawing its presence from Mali, ending its fight with rebel groups.

""Mission accomplished. Private Military Company Wagner returns home,"" the group, founded by the late Yevgeny Prigozhin, announced on social media.

Wagner mercenaries have been fighting alongside Malian government forces since 2021, in attempts to fend off Islamic insurgents.

The group said that it was ending its presence as ""all regional capitals have returned to the control of the legitimate government,"" providing little rationale for the group's exit from the war-torn nation.

Wagner mercenaries and Malian soldiers have reportedly suffered heavy losses in their engagements with Tuareg-led rebels.

The Russian mercenary group, known for its deployment in Ukraine and short-lived rebellion against the Kremlin in 2023, has a strong presence across the African continent, backing Russian business interests and Moscow-friendly regimes.

The mercenaries have been particularly active in Mali since late 2021 and has been accused of perpetrating war crimes and widespread looting. In December 2024, Human Rights Watch accused Wagner mercenaries and Malian government forces of deliberately killing 32 civilians.

The so-called ""Africa Corps,"" under the command of Russia's Defense Ministry, who fought alongside Wagner mercenaries, will continue to have an active presence in Mali.

Mali broke diplomatic ties with Ukraine over its alleged support of Tuareg-led rebels without providing any evidence of direct cooperation. The step was taken after comments by Andrii Yusov, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) spokesperson, about the rebels receiving ""useful information, and not just that, which allowed them to carry out a successful military operation against Russian war criminals.""

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry later denied the country's involved with rebel groups.

U.S. President Donald Trump on June 6 appeared to justify Russia's large-scale attack on Ukrainian cities launched the night before, in response to Ukraine's Operation Spiderweb.

“They gave (Russian President Vladimir) Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them last night,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.

""That's the thing I don't like about it. When I saw it I said 'here we go now it's going to be a strike,' Trump added.

Russia launched a mass missile and drone attack against Ukraine overnight on June 6, targeting the capital, major cities, and the country's far-western regions.

A total of 80 people were injured and four people killed, including first responders, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

The attack comes a day after Putin promised to retaliate against Ukraine for its drone strike against Russian air bases during Operation Spiderweb, in a phone call with Trump.

Ukraine on June 1 launched a game-changing drone attack on four key Russian military airfields, damaging 41 planes, including heavy bombers and rare A-50 spy planes. Kyiv has claimed it had disabled 34% of Russia's strategic bomber fleet in what is seen as one of the most daring operations during the full-scale war.

Trump warned on June 5 that Russia's response to Ukraine's Operation Spiderweb is likely ""not going to be pretty.""

""I don't like it, I said don't do it, you shouldn't do it, you should stop it,"" Trump added.

Despite Trump's repeated calls for hostilities between Russia and Ukraine to end, Trump has continued to delay additional pressures on Moscow through sanctions.

Trump on June 5 sidestepped questions as to when he can be expected to impose additional sanctions on Russia, as the Kremlin continues to reject a ceasefire in Ukraine.

When asked by reporters in the Oval Office as to whether a deadline exists for the implementation of sanction, Trump replied: ""Yes, it's in my brain the deadline,"" without specifying a date.

Previously, Trump said he had not yet imposed new sanctions on Russia because he believed a peace deal might be within reach.

""If I think I'm close to getting a deal, I don't want to screw it up by doing that,"" he said, but added he is prepared to act if Moscow stalls further.

As Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities continue to intensify, Trump previously admitted to sheltering Russia from additional pressures.

""What Vladimir Putin doesn't realize is that if it weren't for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean really bad. He's playing with fire,"" he wrote on Truth Social on May 27, following three days of intense attacks on various regions of Ukraine.

A bipartisan sanctions bill is already awaiting approval in Congress, with provisions for sweeping financial penalties and tariffs on nations buying Russian oil or uranium.

President Volodymyr Zelensky intends to hold a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump during the Group of Seven (G7) summit in Canada, Head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak said on air on June 6.

The summit is scheduled to take place from June 15 to 17 in Kananaskis, Alberta.

Yermak said the Ukrainian delegation’s recent trip to Washington was aimed in part at arranging the high-level meeting between Zelensky and Trump.

The Ukrainian delegation, led by First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Yulia Svyrydenko, arrived in the U.S. on the morning of June 3. The delegation included senior officials from the Defense Ministry and the Presidential Office.

The trip followed Zelensky's statement on June 2 that Ukraine is seeking defense agreements and a free trade deal with the United States. ""I discussed this with President (Donald) Trump... We want to buy (weapons.) This is what the agreement is about – no gifts,"" Zelensky said.

During their visit, the Ukrainian officials were expected to engage with American counterparts on a wide range of critical issues, including ongoing negotiations in Istanbul, sanctions policy against Russia, and continued support for Ukraine amid Russia’s full-scale war.

Following the latest round of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia on June 2, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan suggested that Turkey plans to facilitate a meeting between the leaders of Russia and Ukraine in either Ankara or Istanbul. Speaking to reporters on the same day, Zelensky expressed readiness to take part in such talks.

""I had a conversation with President Erdoğan of Turkey. And indeed, he sent a signal, asking how I would feel about a meeting of four leaders: himself, the President of the United States, Putin, and me. I told him that I support a meeting at the level of leaders, because I have the impression that there will be no ceasefire without our meeting,"" Zelensky said during an online press conference attended by the Kyiv Independent.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161013738.jpg

U.S. President Donald Trump is pulling back from pressuring China over its support for Russia’s war effort, instead prioritizing other aspects of the U.S.-China relationship, U.S. and European officials familiar with internal discussions told Bloomberg.

These officials, speaking anonymously, said that the administration has lowered the issue of Russia's war against Ukraine on its list of foreign policy priorities and is focusing on bilateral issues with Beijing, though they noted Trump could still shift course.

The change in approach marks a departure from the long-held stance of the U.S. and its G7 partners, who have consistently called out China as a key enabler of Russia’s war in Ukraine.

In March, G7 foreign ministers condemned Beijing’s support for Moscow and urged it to use its influence over Russian President Vladimir Putin to help end the war. However, Trump said that ""nothing was discussed concerning Russia/Ukraine"" during his recent call with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Officials suggest this pivot reflects Trump’s desire to break with the foreign policy priorities of former President Joe Biden, who viewed relations with other governments largely through the lens of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Instead, Trump’s team is prioritizing issues like tariffs, technology restrictions, and rare earths. One official noted that Trump is reluctant to directly criticize China’s role in aiding Russia while he continues talks with Putin aimed at brokering a ceasefire.

At the same time, Trump ally Senator Lindsey Graham is pushing for new sanctions against Russia, including measures targeting Chinese and Indian purchases of discounted Russian oil. Graham’s bill has gained over 80 co-sponsors in the Senate, signaling strong bipartisan support. U.S. officials have also expressed frustration at European countries that continue buying Russian energy while criticizing Beijing’s exports to Moscow—exports that include dual-use components and sanctioned technologies used in weapons production.

Despite Trump’s current stance, the European Union has maintained public pressure on China, both through diplomatic channels and public statements. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas recently accused Beijing of fueling Russia’s war through dual-use exports.

Moscow has continued to receive critical components from China, including drone parts, even as Beijing has restricted similar exports to Ukraine and the West. While the Biden administration and EU have sanctioned several Chinese firms involved in aiding Russia’s military production, Trump has yet to impose any new penalties.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-996942026.jpg

Ukraine strikes Russian air bases in 'preemptive strike' ahead of drone, missile attack, General Staff says

Ukrainian forces struck multiple Russian airfields and military facilities overnight on June 6, hours before Russia launched one of its heaviest aerial assaults of the war, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported.

Ukrainian strikes reportedly targeted Engels and Dyagilevo airfields — two key hubs for Russia's long-range bomber fleet, as well as logistics sites in Russia's Kursk Oblast.

Hours after the strikes, Russia attacked Ukraine with 452 drones and 45 missiles in one of the largest attacks of the full-scale war.

Engels-2 air base, located in Saratov Oblast, nearly 600 kilometers (370 miles) from Ukraine's front lines, hosts Russia's Tu-95, Tu-22M3, and Tu-160 bombers — aircraft regularly used in missile attacks on Ukrainian cities.

Ukraine's General Staff said a strike ignited large fires at the facility, hitting at least three fuel tanks. Footage and local reports confirmed a significant blaze and numerous explosions in the area.

Saratov Governor Roman Busargin acknowledged a fire at an unspecified ""industrial enterprise"" and damage from drones to a residential building. No casualties were reported.

The Dyagilevo airfield in Ryazan Oblast, home to air refueling tankers and bomber escort fighters, was also targeted. The General Staff reported fire damage in the area, with Russian air defense activity and explosions recorded. Results of the strike are still being assessed.

Ukraine also claims to have struck a logistics center tied to the 30th Motorized Rifle Regiment of Russia's 72nd Division near Kulbaki in Kursk Oblast.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed that 174 Ukrainian drones were intercepted overnight across 12 regions of Russia and occupied Crimea.

""Strikes on military infrastructure will continue until the Russian Federation's armed aggression against Ukraine is completely stopped,"" Ukraine's General Staff said.

The latest wave of Ukrainian strikes underscores Kyiv's evolving long-range strike capability, as well as its efforts to preemptively degrade Russian assets used in air assaults.

Ukrainian drone attack destroys helicopter at Russian airfield in Bryansk, media says

Ukrainian drones struck Bryansk International Airport in Russia overnight on June 6, destroying one combat helicopter and damaging another, according to Russian emergency officials cited by independent media outlet Astra.

The attack was part of a broader Ukrainian operation targeting multiple Russian airfields and military facilities the same evening.

According to Astra's sources within Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry, the attack destroyed a Mi-8 helicopter after its onboard munitions detonated. A second aircraft, a Mi-35 helicopter gunship, was also damaged, though the extent of the damage remains unclear.

The strike reportedly caused additional destruction to airport infrastructure and rescue facilities, but no casualties were reported. Sources within Ukraine's special services confirmed to Astra that Bryansk airport was among the intended targets of the attack.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

The Mi-8 is a multipurpose utility aircraft used for troop transport, reconnaissance, and close air support. The Mi-35 is a heavily armed assault helicopter derived from the Soviet-era Mi-24, with dual capability for offensive operations and personnel transport.

Both aircraft types are actively used by Russia in its war against Ukraine.

Russia plans to occupy Ukraine east of Dnipro, cut Black Sea access, Ukrainian official says

Russia aims to occupy all Ukrainian territory east of the Dnipro River and advance toward Odesa and Mykolaiv in a broader plan to sever Ukraine's access to the Black Sea, President Volodymyr Zelensky's Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa said, Politico reported on June 6.

The remarks come amid continuing Russian offensives in eastern and northern Ukraine, along with escalating diplomatic efforts that have yet to yield a ceasefire.

According to Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR), Moscow hopes to seize the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts by this fall and establish a buffer zone along Ukraine's northern border with Russia.

The second phase of the plan envisions more ambitious territorial gains, including an advance into southern Ukraine aimed at cutting the country off from the sea.

""Unfortunately, they are not speaking about peace. They are preparing for war,"" Palisa said during a press briefing at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington.

The warning comes days after Russia presented Ukraine with a so-called ""peace memorandum"" during a second round of negotiations in Istanbul on June 2.

The document, published by Russian state media outlet TASS, demands that Kyiv recognize Russia's claimed annexation of four Ukrainian oblasts — Kherson, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Luhansk — and fully withdraw from them.

Moscow also calls for Ukraine's demobilization and a formal ban on NATO membership.

During the talks, Ukraine's delegation submitted a separate proposal calling for an all-for-all prisoner exchange, the return of abducted Ukrainian children, and the release of civilians held in Russian captivity.

Kyiv also reiterated its call for a Western-backed 30-day ceasefire as a foundation for future negotiations — a proposal Moscow again rejected.

Ukraine's military leadership has warned that Russian forces are preparing for a major summer offensive in Donetsk Oblast, where daily assaults have continued since 2022.

Despite suffering heavy losses, Russian troops are advancing through mass wave attacks that gain only tens of meters per day. According to the U.S.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Moscow currently occupies roughly 20% of Ukraine.

The White House is urging Republican Senator Lindsey Graham to soften his sanctions bill against Russia, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on June 6, citing congressional staffers.

The bipartisan sanctions bill, introduced on April 1 by Graham and Senate Democrat Richard Blumenthal, seeks to impose a 500% tariff on imports from countries that continue purchasing Russian oil and raw materials.

In recent weeks, Trump administration officials have contacted Graham's office with requests to water down the legislation, congressional aides told the WSJ.

The White House reportedly asked Graham to insert waivers into the bill allowing Trump to choose which entities get sanctioned and changing the word ""shall"" to ""may."" Removing the mandatory language from the text would essentially defang the bill, staffers said.

Blumenthal confirmed that negotiations with Trump officials were taking place behind the scene but did not comment on the substance of the talks.

""We're moving ahead and the White House is included in our conversations,"" he told the WSJ.

Earlier, Republican Senator Roger Wicker on June 4 said that Trump had asked the Senate to postpone voting on the bill, which had been scheduled to come to the floor this week.

In a joint press conference alongside German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on June 5, Trump said lawmakers were waiting for his approval before advancing the sanctions bill.

""They'll be guided by me. That's how it's supposed to be,"" Trump said. ""They're waiting for me to decide on what to do.""

In the same briefing, Trump said that he had a deadline in mind for when he would enforce new sanctions on Russia but did not give specifics, saying only that sanctions would be imposed when it became clear that peace talks were not moving forward. He also said that sanctions could apply to both Russia and Ukraine.

""It takes two to tango,"" he said.

During the June 5 press conference, Trump compared Ukraine and Russia — which launched an unprovoked full-scale invasion against Ukraine in February 2022 and partially occupies four Ukrainian regions in addition to the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula — to children fighting on a playground.

""Sometimes you're better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart,"" he said.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose sanctions on Russia if he does not see progress in peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow.

He has never followed through on any of these threats.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/GettyImages-2218789844.jpg

Russia's National Guard (Rosgvardia) killed a man who was attempting to carry out a drone attack on a military facility in Ryazan Oblast, the agency alleged on June 6.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claim.

National Guard officers thwarted an alleged ""terrorist attack"" at a military facility operated by a Russian state security agency, Rosgvardia said in a statement. An armed man was said to be preparing to launch a drone packed with grenades.

When officers attempted to arrest the suspect, the man ""resisted with armed force and was neutralized,"" the statement read.

The statement did not specify which military facility was allegedly targeted.

Rosgvardia's claim comes less than a week after Ukraine launched a mass strike against four Russian air bases using first-person-view (FPV) drones smuggled into the country. Among the targets was the Dyagilevo airfield in Ryazan Oblast.

The alleged attempted attack also follows a night of what Ukraine's General Staff called ""preemptive"" strikes on airfields across Russia. The Dyagilevo airfield was one of the sites targeted.

DONETSK OBLAST – From the moment the vehicles duck into pre-prepared positions in the leafy treeline to the first dead Russian soldiers, less than twenty minutes pass.

\With the morning sun steadily rising after the team of six complete their short commute to work, the equipment is set up in a clockwork-like rhythm: long telescopic antennas are raised to just peak out of the treeline and sway in the light wind, cables are unravelled, and camping chairs are laid out so the men can work in absolute comfort.

Out of heavy-duty plastic travel cases emerge the soldiers’ weapons of choice: DJI Mavic drones, available all over the world in shops and of the kind used by civilian video bloggers and aerial photographers everywhere.

Here in Donetsk Oblast, just west of the embattled city of Pokrovsk and only a few kilometers away from Russian positions, lost time means missed opportunities to stop the enemy creeping forward to Ukrainian lines.

When your unit is consistently deployed to the hottest parts of the front line to do exactly that, every minute counts.

Commander Oleksandr “Zalizniak” is the first to fly out, with an unassuming little munition strapped to the bottom of his Mavic.

Zalizniak leads an elite Ukrainian drone unit known as the Peaky Blinders, named after the hit television show which inspired the group’s custom-made camouflage flat caps that they often wear on positions.

The unit was formed from a group of friends from Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, and its surrounds. Consisting of businessmen, lawyers, local officials, and IT specialists, Peaky Blinders now serve under the banner of the Omega special operations unit of Ukraine’s National Guard.

Although they also use the more well-known first-person view (FPV) drones, the Peaky Blinders’ specialty is the use of Mavics as bomber drones to target expendable Russian foot soldiers, which have become the core of Moscow’s assault tactics in Ukraine.

The Kyiv Independent spent a full day embedded with the unit in late April.

Low on battery and needing to return soon if he doesn’t hit a target, Zalizniak spots movement in a treeline with thin foliage cover – two Russian troops, carrying something large between them.

As commander and the most experienced Mavic pilot, it doesn’t take long for Zalizniak to close in on his target, hovering over 50 meters above as he releases the bomb with the push of a button.

The result is spectacular: a red-hot fireball bursts out of the large item carried by the Russian soldiers, which turned out to be a fuel canister.

Both infantrymen, wounded from the blast itself, are quickly engulfed in flames. The drone lingers to watch their last moments, burning alive among the trees on another country’s soil.

“Look at the two of them, they burned up at work,” says the commander with the wry small and dark humor that only someone who does his kind of job could have.

Without enough battery to return, Zalizniak’s drone is lost, but it’s a small price to pay for what was achieved, as those two soldiers’ journey toward Ukrainian lines was ended, forever.

“The protection of our infantry is our main driving ideology and our motivation, so that as many of them as possible will one day return home” he said.

“The way I see it, for this whole war, we haven’t actually killed anyone, instead we have saved hundreds of lives.”

Unique formula

After the initial adrenaline of the double hit on the Russian infantryman, the Peaky Blinders find time for a morning coffee and settle into the simple routine that will continue for the rest of the day: change batteries and attach bombs, fly out, look for the enemy, drop bombs, return, and repeat.

Looking at the team spread out among the treeline, it is immediately clear that this is no ordinary drone unit.

Instead of a dugout, they prefer to work from camping chairs out in the fresh air, especially when weather allows.

More strikingly, nobody is watching the live reconnaissance streams of the front line that have become ubiquitous in every Ukrainian drone team or command post.

Instead, the team consists solely of those who fly drones and those who arm them.

In their eyes, there is no need for more; the Peaky Blinders’ philosophy is underpinned by their motto: To find and destroy.

Compared to the work of a standard strike FPV team, where a target is first found by reconnaissance teams, only after which a drone is sent out to hit it, this unit does both on the same flight, giving them the ability to strike immediately after spotting an enemy soldier.

“We made our own antennas with amplification, and we can now fly out 8–9 kilometers,” said Zalizniak.

“Thanks to that, we’re getting a big result — we're flying into their rear, where they don't expect to see us. But because of that, we're also losing drones.”

After moving positions before lunch due to neighboring electronic warfare activity disrupting their work, the four pilots once again fly out into the Russian rear, but in the midday heat, the Russian soldiers are nowhere to be seen out and about.

Often, Zalizniak told the Kyiv Independent, when conditions are too good for drone flying, Russian soldiers stay put in basements or other forms of cover.

When targets are less keen to come out into the open, one of the most important skills of any aspiring Mavic bomber pilot becomes spotting even the slightest movement on the screen of their remote control.

Unlike the cheap cameras on expendable FPV drones, Mavic drones are equipped with high-definition cameras, and some have significant zoom abilities, making them the perfect tool for such joint reconnaissance/bomber missions.

""This is where I find creativity,” said pilot Maksym “Mytrych.”

“Right here — in the very process of fighting the enemy. It's incredibly interesting — how to approach, from which side. For me, it’s like a kind of dance.""

March of death

These Russian assaults represent fresh attempts by Moscow to deepen the pincers around the embattled city of Pokrovsk, which has been the central hotspot of the front line since last autumn.

East of Pokrovsk, after a period of stability over early spring, Russian forces broke across the Pokrovsk-Kostiantynivka highway, creating a threatening salient that continues to be expanded.

Here on the western flank of the city however, Moscow has much less success, stuck just a few kilometers east of the border with Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.

But, according to commander Zalizniak, this is not for a lack of trying.

“The enemy has been very active since we've been working here and has been carrying out assaults the whole time,” he said.

“Sometimes they were weaker, sometimes stronger, but they have been happening constantly — from morning to evening, and even at night.”

Small, nimble, and easy to deploy quickly, the Peaky Blinders are consistently deployed to some of the hottest sectors of the front line, specialized as they are in repelling enemy infantry assaults.

Before being deployed to Donetsk Oblast in the fall of 2024, they played a crucial role in bogging down Russia’s surprise cross-border offensive on Kharkiv Oblast, headed for the city that the unit was formed to defend in the first place.

Now, with Russian forces increasingly relying on waves of squad-level infantry attacks to overwhelm overstretched Ukrainian lines, their work is crucial in keeping key sectors stable.

In conditions of an ever-deepening crisis in infantry strength across the Ukrainian military, it has become more important than ever to eliminate Russian assault groups with drones and artillery long before they reach Ukrainian positions.

Over five days of the group's work near Pokrovsk in spring, according to Zalizniak, the Peaky Blinders stopped 106 enemy soldiers in their tracks; numbers higher than most entire specialized drone battalions in standard Ukrainian brigades, achieved by a team of only six in the field.

On top of their unique team set-up the Peaky Blinders have one more trick up their sleeve that sets their work above most.

Often, bomb-dropping squads arm their Mavics with hand grenades or grenade launcher roads, but, seeing the need for a more effective munition, the unit collaborated with a local manufacturer to produce the gruesomely named Foot Crusher.

Deceptively light but packed with hundreds of small metal balls, the bomb usually does enough damage to stop a Russian soldier in their tracks, even if the drop does not land a direct hit.

Telegram front

As the day goes on, moments with the sound of a drone above — whether a Mavic, FPV, or larger fixed-wing drone — not present are few and far between.

Most are friendly, but if there is any doubt, the team quickly drops what they are doing, grabbing their rifles and portable electronic warfare units to face down the enemy threat.

Around 3 p.m. comes an attack from weapons that can not be shot down or evaded — glide bombs. The first group lands further away, but the second is aimed right at the treeline.

“Everyone in the trench!” yells Zalizniak, as the team ducks for cover, “and don’t forget to start recording!”

The explosions — three of them — tear through the air and send ripples through the ground as the soldiers wait for the all clear.

Taking shelter in a narrow trench, Artem “Deputat,” who today is responsible for preparing the Foot Crushers, takes a moment to go over the videos recorded from the day’s work so far.

“That's it, he's wounded for sure,” he says, watching the recording of a hit on a Russian soldier. This time, it’s the handiwork of Dmytro “Advokat” (“Lawyer” in Ukrainian), who was a lawyer in Kharkiv in civilian life and now continues to run a large volunteer operation alongside his service.

“100% . Look, he froze — see?,” said Deputat, watching the playback. “My hands are shaking from happiness.”

After a successful hit, the team makes sure to save the video to post to their unit’s social media accounts later.

With their trademark flat caps, endearing back story, and proof of effective work, the Peaky Blinders have developed an unmistakable brand as a unit, recently launching an online merchandise store where anyone can buy hoodies and tee-shirts emblazoned with the unit’s logo and pictures of the iconic Foot Crusher.

As gruesome as they can be, videos of drone hits have become a key part of the information fabric of this war on both sides.

This macabre collection of greatest hits fulfils several purposes: proof of the unit’s effective work attracts donations for drones and supplies, gives a morale boost for viewers all over Ukraine, and shows the real fate of Russians who enlist to make a quick buck.

Compared to the more common FPV footage circulating the net, recordings from Mavics come with the advantage of the high-quality image, making it possible to make out the whites in the eyes of Russian soldiers in the last moments of their lives.

“One Russian sent a video (to the unit’s account) and wrote, 'Hi, that’s me in the video,'” recalled Zalizniak, “he recognized himself in the footage — he was seriously wounded there.

According to Zalizniak, the Russian soldier was from a “Storm V” unit, made of convicts from the Russian prison system often coerced into service as expendable assault troops with a promise of a pardon.

“He was injured and became disabled afterwards, but he thanked our pilot for giving him a 'white ticket' (exemption from service), and for not finishing him off,” he added.

No stopping soon

On the horizon to the south, dark clouds begin to unload rain as the day’s work slowly comes to an end.

While Mytrych, Deputat and the others begin packing up, Zalizniak and Advokat continue flying until the last possible moments: dusk tends to be the time for increased Russian activity as Ukrainian drone teams transition from day to night shifts.

While most drone units often spend several days at position at a time before resting, the Peaky Blinders commute in and out on a daily basis, laser-focused on their specialized task of bombing Russian soldiers by day.

While they don’t have to sleep out in the field, the routine is exhausting in its own way, but worth it, said Deputat.

“Whether you like it or not, the main thing is that you see the result of this work,” he said.

“You see your comrades who are devoted to this task, and you realize that you're all focused on one shared, effective outcome that you're achieving together.”

On the drive back to their base in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, the team crosses open fields that will remain unplanted and unharvested this summer.

Their vehicles are protected with electronic warfare devices for the short but deadly drive, but now, with the advent of unjammable Russian fiber optic drones, they always have to keep an eye out for hunters in the air.

With Russian advances gaining pace across key sectors of the front line over May and into June, soldiers here have little faith in renewed attempts to reach at least a ceasefire through negotiations.

Instead, said Deputat, groups like the Peaky Blinders see clearly that the only real efforts for peace are forged by their own hands, by stopping Russia here on the battlefield.

“In truth, I’ve come to understand one golden essence and truth: decisions aren’t made back there in offices — they’re made here, on the ground, locally,” he said, “that’s the objective truth of the modern world.”

“I want peace, but seeing the efforts made for the so-called resolution of the conflict, I don’t see that peace.”

Russia's central bank on June 6 lowered its soaring interest rate from 21% to 20%, indicating easing pressures from inflation.

The decision marks Russia's first rate cut since September 2022.

The central bank decreased rates by 100 basis points, bringing it to 20% from the 21% rate established in October 2024 — the country's highest level since the early 200s. The move follows a drop in inflation, which fell from 10.7% in January to 6.2% in April, according to Russian official data.

""While domestic demand growth is still outstripping the capabilities to expand the supply of goods and services, the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path,"" the central bank said in a statement on June 6.

Still, fiscal policy will remain tight ""for a long period"" as Russia aims to return inflation to its 4% target, the bank said.

The rate decrease comes amid pressures from politicians to lower rates due to concerns of stagnating economic growth.

Russian Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov on June urged the central bank to cut rates in order to boost growth, aiming to achieve a 3% growth target set by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Elvira Nabiullina, the governor of the Russian central bank, has been hiking borrowing costs in response to skyrocketing inflation. Nabiullina has been credited with keeping the Russian economy afloat as the West imposed massive international sanctions following Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Putin, however, has expressed displeasure with the decline in private investment due to the high cost of credit.

Russia has been forced to slash key projects across various sectors in the face of an economic slowdown, brought on in part by plummeting oil prices. Major Russian exporters have also cut down on rail shipments of metals and oil products, even beyond earlier projected reductions.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/GettyImages-2210058294.jpg

U.S. President Donald Trump offered to increase supplies of American energy exports to Berlin but did not pledge additional military support to Ukraine or sanctions on Russia in a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on June 5.

The meeting was Merz's first visit to the White House since becoming chancellor.

When asked whether Trump would impose additional sanctions on Russia, the president dodged the question by boasting that he ""ended Nord Stream 2"" and hinting at future energy deals with Germany.

""We have so much oil and gas, you will not be able to buy it all. ... I hope we'll be able to make that part of our trade deal,"" Trump said during a joint press conference with Merz.

While Merz spoke of a ""duty"" to assist Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression, Trump did not make any commitments to further military aid for Kyiv. In the same press conference, he compared Russia and Ukraine to fighting children and refused to name a deadline for imposing sanctions on Moscow.

Merz nonetheless praised Trump's role as a peacemaker between the two nations.

""I told the president before we came in: He is the key person in the world who can really (end the war) by putting pressure on Russia.""

Trump has frequently brought up Europe's reliance on Russian energy when questioned about Washington's role in pressuring the Kremlin or supporting Ukraine.

Nord Stream 1 and 2 are gas pipelines running between Russia and Germany under the Baltic Sea. Nord Stream 2 has never been activated, and the pipes shut down after suspected sabotage in 2022.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed in March that discussions were underway with the U.S. to resume gas flows through the pipelines. Trump has pursued warmer relations and stronger economic ties with Moscow since his inauguration in January 2025.

Merz said on May 28 that the German government will ""do everything to ensure that Nord Stream 2 cannot be put back into operation,"" German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on May 28.

The leaders' discussion on June 6 focused primarily on Russia's war against Ukraine, NATO, and trade policy, Merz said in Berlin the day after the meeting.

Ukrainian drones struck Bryansk International Airport in Russia overnight on June 6, destroying one combat helicopter and damaging another, according to Russian emergency officials cited by independent media outlet Astra.

The attack was part of a broader Ukrainian operation targeting multiple Russian airfields and military facilities the same evening.

According to Astra's sources within Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry, the attack destroyed a Mi-8 helicopter after its onboard munitions detonated. A second aircraft, a Mi-35 helicopter gunship, was also damaged, though the extent of the damage remains unclear.

The strike reportedly caused additional destruction to airport infrastructure and rescue facilities, but no casualties were reported. Sources within Ukraine's special services confirmed to Astra that Bryansk airport was among the intended targets of the attack.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

The Mi-8 is a multipurpose utility aircraft used for troop transport, reconnaissance, and close air support. The Mi-35 is a heavily armed assault helicopter derived from the Soviet-era Mi-24, with dual capability for offensive operations and personnel transport.

Both aircraft types are actively used by Russia in its war against Ukraine.

Hours before Russia launched one of the largest aerial assaults of the war, Ukrainian forces hit strategic bomber bases at Engels and Dyagilevo, along with logistical hubs in Kursk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported.

At the Engels-2 air base in Saratov Oblast, located roughly 600 kilometers (370 miles) from Ukraine's front lines, Ukrainian strikes ignited fires at three fuel tanks, causing large-scale explosions.

The Dyagilevo airfield in Ryazan Oblast, home to refueling tankers and fighter escorts for Russia's long-range bomber fleet, was also targeted. Fires and explosions were reported in the vicinity, and Russian air defenses were activated in the region.

Ukraine's expanded drone campaign reflects a growing capacity to strike deep into Russian territory, as Kyiv continues to target the infrastructure Moscow uses to sustain its air war.

The overnight strikes come just days after the launch of Operation Spiderweb on June 1, in which Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) struck four air bases across Russia and reportedly damaged 41 bomber aircraft.

That operation alone caused over $7 billion in damage and marked a major escalation in Ukraine's ability to project force across the border, according to SBU.

Russia responded to the latest round of Ukrainian strikes by unleashing 452 drones and 45 missiles against cities across Ukraine, killing at least five people and injuring 73 in one of the heaviest barrages of the full-scale invasion.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/--------------.jpg

Russia is prepared to offer political asylum to tech billionaire Elon Musk following his public feud with U.S. President Donald Trump, Dmitry Novikov, deputy chair of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, said June 6.

""I think Musk is playing a completely different game, that he won't need political asylum, although if he did, Russia could certainly provide it,"" Novikov told the state-run news agency TASS.

The remarks came days after Musk's 130-day stint as head of a temporary federal commission ended on May 30, and amid deepening tensions between the Tesla CEO and Trump.

The feud began when Musk publicly criticized the administration's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" a sweeping tax proposal that economists warn could expand the U.S. deficit by $600 billion.

Trump responded by personally attacking Musk during his meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on June 5. In his Truth Social post, Trump said that Musk ""just went crazy.""

Musk replied on social media that Trump owed his electoral victory to him, claiming that without his influence, Democrats would have maintained control of the House.

Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council and a frequent purveyor of anti-Western rhetoric, joked on X that Moscow would broker peace between ""D and E"" — referring to Trump and Musk — in exchange for Starlink shares.

""Don't fight, guys,"" Medvedev wrote.

Musk was a key figure in Trump's campaign and early administration. As head of the government efficiency task force, he led efforts to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which has provided over $37 billion in aid to Ukraine.

Despite initially supporting Ukraine and providing Starlink satellite systems to bolster military communications, Musk has increasingly echoed Russian narratives.

The billionaire has falsely claimed that President Volodymyr Zelensky has little support in Ukraine and accused Kyiv of waging a ""never-ending draft meat grinder.""

He has also lobbied against U.S. military assistance to Ukraine, arguing it only prolongs the war — a line frequently used by Kremlin officials to discourage Western backing for Kyiv.

Meaghan Mobbs, daughter of U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg, made a direct appeal to her father on social media during Russia’s combined missile and drone attack on Ukraine overnight on June 6.

""Loud night in Kyiv, Dad! It might be the explosions and gunfire in the dead of night, but I get the strange feeling the Russians don't want peace,"" Mobbs wrote on X, as Russia launched one of its most intense air assaults of the war.

According to Ukraine’s Air Force, Moscow fired 452 drones — including Iranian-designed Shahed-type drones — and 45 missiles of various types across Ukraine, targeting the capital, major cities, and even western regions of the country.

Ukrainian defenders intercepted 199 drones and 36 missiles, while another 169 drones disappeared from radar, likely decoys used to saturate air defenses.

Multiple fires broke out across Kyiv after strikes hit residential areas and infrastructure.

Nationwide, at least five civilians were killed and 73 injured during the past day, according to regional authorities. Ukraine's Air Force repelled the barrage with aviation, electronic warfare, mobile fire groups, and missile defense systems.

Mobbs, a U.S. former paratrooper and longtime advocate for Ukraine, heads the R.T. Weatherman Foundation, which has delivered over 10,000 pallets of medical supplies and humanitarian aid to more than 70 Ukrainian hospitals and organizations.

The large-scale assault came as Russia continues to reject calls for a ceasefire and escalates its air campaign despite mounting international pressure and ongoing negotiations.

Kellogg has not yet commented on the attacks.

The European Union is considering placing Russia on its ""gray list"" of countries with inadequate controls against money laundering, the Financial Times reported June 6, citing officials from the European Commission.

Inclusion on the list would damage Russia's global financial standing and compel banks to apply stricter scrutiny to transactions involving Russian individuals or entities — raising compliance costs and increasing operational burdens.

Although the decision was expected this week, the European Commission delayed a final ruling due to “administrative or procedural reasons,” according to the Financial Times. A decision is now expected early next week.

""There is huge support for putting Russia on the list,"" said Markus Ferber, a German MEP who oversees economic affairs for the European People's Party, the EU's main center-right bloc.

Most European Parliament members reportedly back the move, though no consensus has yet been formalized. The EU's gray list generally mirrors the assessments of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international watchdog on money laundering and terrorism financing.

Russia's FATF membership was suspended in 2023, after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Efforts to list Russia on the grey list have faced resistance, as countries with close ties to Moscow are likely to block any formal move for enhanced monitoring.

The EU's most recent internal draft of the gray list includes countries such as Algeria, Kenya, Laos, and Venezuela. Several others — including Barbados, the United Arab Emirates, and Senegal — are expected to be removed.

If implemented, the designation would further isolate Moscow from global markets and tighten compliance obligations on any remaining cross-border financial operations involving Russian institutions.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2153497772.jpg

Engels-2 air base, located in Saratov Oblast, nearly 600 kilometers (370 miles) from Ukraine's front lines, hosts Russia's Tu-95, Tu-22M3, and Tu-160 bombers — aircraft regularly used in missile attacks on Ukrainian cities.

Ukraine's General Staff said a strike ignited large fires at the facility, hitting at least three fuel tanks. Footage and local reports confirmed a significant blaze and numerous explosions in the area.

Saratov Governor Roman Busargin acknowledged a fire at an unspecified ""industrial enterprise"" and damage from drones to a residential building. No casualties were reported.

The Dyagilevo airfield in Ryazan Oblast, home to air refueling tankers and bomber escort fighters, was also targeted. The General Staff reported fire damage in the area, with Russian air defense activity and explosions recorded. Results of the strike are still being assessed.

Ukraine also claims to have struck a logistics center tied to the 30th Motorized Rifle Regiment of Russia's 72nd Division near Kulbaki in Kursk Oblast.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed that 174 Ukrainian drones were intercepted overnight across 12 regions of Russia and occupied Crimea.

""Strikes on military infrastructure will continue until the Russian Federation's armed aggression against Ukraine is completely stopped,"" Ukraine's General Staff said.

The latest wave of Ukrainian strikes underscores Kyiv's evolving long-range strike capability, as well as its efforts to preemptively degrade Russian assets used in air assaults.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on June 1 launched Operation Spiderweb, a daring mass drone attack that damaged 41 Russian heavy bombers at four key airfields throughout the country.

The operation reportedly targeted A-50, Tu-95, and Tu-22 M3 planes parked at the Belaya, Diaghilev, Olenya, and Ivanovo air bases, causing approximately $7 billion in damage.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/2092245-298156-756x425-2.jpg

At least five civilians were killed and 73 others injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over the past 24 hours, regional authorities reported on June 6.

Russia launched 452 drones overnight, including Iranian-designed Shahed-type suicide drones, along with 45 missiles of various types, Ukraine's Air Force reported.

Air defenses intercepted 199 drones, while another 169 dropped off radars — likely used as decoys to overwhelm Ukrainian systems. Ukrainian forces also intercepted 36 missiles, including the Iskander-M ballistic missile.

The attack was repelled using aviation, electronic warfare units, mobile fire groups, and anti-aircraft missile systems.

Kyiv suffered the highest number of fatalities, where at least four civilians were killed and 20 others injured, including 16 hospitalized, according to Mayor Vitali Klitschko.

In Volyn Oblast, 15 people were injured. Drones damaged an apartment building, blowing out windows and tearing through its roof, the local State Emergency Service said.

Ternopil Oblast saw 10 people injured in strikes on civilian areas, including five members of the State Emergency Service, Governor Vyacheslav Negoda reported.

Four people were also wounded in Chernihiv Oblast and multiple homes were damaged by Russian strikes, Governor Viacheslav Chaus reported.

In Donetsk Oblast, six residents were injured — two each in Krynytsi, Pokrovsk, and Kostyantynivka — amid continued Russian shelling, Governor Vadym Filashkin said.

Kharkiv Oblast reported three injuries following attacks on six settlements across the region, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. In Kherson Oblast, 10 people were injured after Russian forces shelled residential areas and public infrastructure, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin.

Poltava Oblast recorded three injuries after missiles hit administrative buildings, commercial warehouses, and a local coffee shop, Governor Volodymyr Kohut said.

In Sumy Oblast, two civilians born in 1966 and 1967 were wounded. Russian troops carried out nearly 110 attacks on 47 settlements in the region, local authorities said.

Russia aims to occupy all Ukrainian territory east of the Dnipro River and advance toward Odesa and Mykolaiv in a broader plan to sever Ukraine's access to the Black Sea, President Volodymyr Zelensky's Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa said, Politico reported on June 6.

The remarks come amid continuing Russian offensives in eastern and northern Ukraine, along with escalating diplomatic efforts that have yet to yield a ceasefire.

According to Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR), Moscow hopes to seize the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts by this fall and establish a buffer zone along Ukraine's northern border with Russia.

The second phase of the plan envisions more ambitious territorial gains, including an advance into southern Ukraine aimed at cutting the country off from the sea.

""Unfortunately, they are not speaking about peace. They are preparing for war,"" Palisa said during a press briefing at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington.

The warning comes days after Russia presented Ukraine with a so-called ""peace memorandum"" during a second round of negotiations in Istanbul on June 2.

The document, published by Russian state media outlet TASS, demands that Kyiv recognize Russia's claimed annexation of four Ukrainian oblasts — Kherson, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Luhansk — and fully withdraw from them.

Moscow also calls for Ukraine's demobilization and a formal ban on NATO membership.

During the talks, Ukraine's delegation submitted a separate proposal calling for an all-for-all prisoner exchange, the return of abducted Ukrainian children, and the release of civilians held in Russian captivity.

Kyiv also reiterated its call for a Western-backed 30-day ceasefire as a foundation for future negotiations — a proposal Moscow again rejected.

Ukraine's military leadership has warned that Russian forces are preparing for a major summer offensive in Donetsk Oblast, where daily assaults have continued since 2022.

Despite suffering heavy losses, Russian troops are advancing through mass wave attacks that gain only tens of meters per day.

An oil refinery in the city of Engels in Russia's Saratov Oblast was engulfed in flames after an overnight Ukrainian drone attack on June 6, Russian officials and media outlets reported.

Ukraine has previously targeted the Kristal Plant, an oil refinery in Engels that supplies fuel to Russia's Engels-2 military airfield. The airfield is one of the country's key strategic military bases. It hosts long-range bombers, including the nuclear-capable Tu-95 and Tu-160 aircraft.

Residents shared footage of major fires breaking out in Engels following a drone attack, according to the independent Russian Telegram news channel Astra. Locals reported that the refinery was under attack and that a residential building had been hit.

The Saratov airport imposed restrictions due to the drone threat, according to Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya).

Saratov Oblast Governor Roman Busargin claimed that a fire had broken out at an unspecified ""industrial enterprise"" and that emergency responders had been dispatched to the scene. He also said drones caused damage to a residential building. No casualties were reported.

The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that 174 Ukrainian drones were intercepted overnight, targeting 12 regions within Russia as well as Russian-occupied Crimea.

The Kyiv Independent could not confirm these claims.

The reported drone attack comes after a series of major Ukrainian strikes against military targets inside Russia.

The operation reportedly targeted A-50, Tu-95, and Tu-22 M3 planes parked at the Belaya, Diaghilev, Olenya, and Ivanovo air bases, causing approximately $7 billion in damage.

In the following days, Ukraine carried out strikes against Russia's Crimean Bridge, a military base in distant Vladivostok, and a missile base in Bryansk Oblast.

Located in Russia's Saratov Oblast, around 600 kilometers (370 miles) from the front lines in Ukraine, the Engels-2 base has been a frequent target of Ukrainian strikes since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. The airfield houses three types of strategic bombers regularly used in missile attacks on Ukraine: the Tu-95, Tu-22, and Tu-160.

Drones struck a Russian military plant in Michurinsk, Tambov Oblast, in the early hours of June 6, according to media outlets in Russia.

Attacks were also reported in Russia's Saratov, Moscow, Tula, Belgorod, and Kaluga oblasts.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports at the time of publication.

The JSC Progress Plant in the city of Michurinsk in Tambov Oblast came under fire overnight, Russian Telegram news channels reported, citing local residents. A drone allegedly hit the plant's workshop, causing a fire.

Russian officials have not yet commented on the attack.

The JSC Progress Plant produces high-tech aviation and missile control systems, along with equipment for gas and oil pipelines. The plant was reportedly hit in a previous attack in December 2024.

On the same night, Russian outlets also reported that an oil refinery in Saratov Oblast came under attack. The Kristal Plant, which supplies fuel to the Engels-2 military airfield, was engulfed in flames after a drone strike. Ukraine has targeted the facility in past attacks.

A train derailed in Belgorod Oblast after an explosive device detonated under the tracks, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov claimed. Part of the track was damaged, but there were no casualties, he said.

In the Russian capital, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin claimed that air defense units repelled 10 drones bound for Moscow. Sobyanin said that emergency services had been dispatched to the sites of the fallen wreckage, but did not disclose information regarding any damage.

Kaluga Oblast Governor Vladislav Shapsha reported that five drones were downed over the region, damaging cars.

In Tula Oblast, air defense units reportedly intercepted two drones. Three people were injured, according to Governor Dmitry Milyaev.

The reported attacks come the same night that Russia launched another large-scale drone and missile attack against Ukraine. The attack killed four people in Kyiv and caused casualties and damage to cities in western Ukraine, far from the front lines.

As peace negotiations stall and Russia refuses the accept a ceasefire, the war has escalated.

Russia intensified aerial assaults on Ukrainian cities in late May, launching some of the heaviest assaults of the full-scale war over three consecutive nights. Less than a week later, Ukraine launched Operation Spiderweb, an audacious mass drone strike that reportedly damaged 41 Russian military planes.

The European Union is set to reinstate tariffs on Ukrainian agricultural exports on June 6.

This is the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion that the EU will not renew an agreement suspending trade barriers between Ukraine and Europe.

The end of tariff-free trade comes amid mounting opposition to Ukrainian exports — and Ukraine's EU accession — from eastern European bloc members, including Poland and Hungary.

While a transitional agreement will govern trade to the end of 2025, negotiations between Brussels and Ukraine for a more favorable long-term agreement began on June 2, according to European Pravda.

The temporary arrangement from June 6 allows for more liberal trade than established under earlier rules. But tariffs will return in full starting in 2026 — unless talks in Brussels succeed in updating the pre-war framework.

The talks will test the EU's ability to balance concerns from member states with Ukraine's closer integration into the trading bloc.

How wartime trade relief for Ukraine impacted EU states

The so-called Autonomous Trade Measures (ATMs) were introduced in June 2022 shortly after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. They removed tariffs that applied to some Ukrainian agricultural goods under a 2016 trade agreement, including sugar, honey, wheat, and poultry.

Along with ""solidarity lanes,"" which established alternative logistics routes, the 2022 trade measures facilitated the export of Ukrainian agricultural goods by land, bypassing Ukrainian ports blockaded by Russia in the Black Sea.

With maritime exports paralyzed, overland shipments to EU neighbors — especially to Poland, Romania, and Hungary — surged, provoking protests from local farmers who claimed Ukrainian goods were overwhelming markets and lowering prices.

Although Brussels initially intervened to curb Ukrainian imports, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary applied unilateral bans on some Ukrainian goods in September 2023, citing national security issues but defying EU trade rules.

The influx following the trade measures set to expire on June 6 has been touted as a sign of Ukraine's incompatibility with the EU. The issue was on the campaign agenda in the recent Polish presidential election, with both candidates voicing concerns over Ukrainian agricultural imports.

According to Svitlana Taran, policy analyst at the Brussels-based European Policy Centre, the 2022 trade measures were not the main driver of the surge.

""Politicians have accused ATMs as the primary reason for this situation, which is not the case,"" she told the Kyiv Independent.

""This was an exceptional situation caused by the sudden collapse of Ukraine's main export routes. The influx was not caused by the removal of tariffs, but by Russia's invasion and blockade, and insufficient transport capacities. The suspension of tariffs was just one of the factors, and after Ukraine unblocked Black Sea channels, this situation was eased.""

European imports of Ukrainian products whose tariffs were lifted did initially spike to an unprecedented level of over 900 million euros, but then quickly declined. Imports of these goods are now generally higher than they were before the full-scale invasion, but not at unprecedented levels.

""This example cannot be used to frighten EU farmers that it would be a normal situation if they open their markets to Ukrainian agriculture,"" Taran added.

There is also little evidence that Ukrainian products affected prices in bordering countries.

""We looked at (prices) for sugar and found no evidence,"" Stephan Cramon-Taubadel, chair of Agricultural Policy at the University of Gottingen, told the Kyiv Independent.

""I currently have some preliminary results that show slightly depressed local prices for wheat in eastern Polish regions bordering Ukraine in parts of 2023 and 2024, but it's much less than it's made out to be, and something that the EU could easily compensate.""

Nevertheless, Brussels will not renew the ATMs following longstanding pressure from eastern European countries looking to appease the farmers' lobby.

More roadblocks on Ukraine's European path

The reversion to pre-war rules is a step back for Ukraine's exporters.

The EU has become a closer trading partner for Ukraine since the full-scale invasion began. Over 60% of Ukraine's exports now go to the EU, relative to about 40% before the war.

Reverting to the pre-war rules may pose challenges to Ukrainian exporters, who have adapted to trade with fewer tariffs.

""It's a challenge, because it's not something businesses were fully prepared for,"" Veronika Movchan, academic director at the Institute for Economic Research and Policy Consulting, told the Kyiv Independent.

""Many hoped that the measures would continue, at least to some extent. I expect that some businesses made decisions based on the existing regime.""

The Ukrainian Agribusiness Club estimates that, in 2025, Ukraine will lose up to 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in foreign exchange earnings under the temporary measures, and 3.3 billion euros ($3.7 billion) next year if no agreement is reached.

But there may even be barriers to reverting back to the 2016 trading rules, given the fraught politics surrounding the bans currently imposed by Poland, Hungary and Slovakia.

""It's not even apparent that, when the free trade measures expire on Friday, these countries will lift the bans,"" said Movchan.

""Some member states even imposed bans on goods that didn't have any barriers before the war, such as sunflower seeds and rapeseed.""

The episode highlights the potential for domestic politics within the EU and bilateral disputes to impede closer trade relations with Ukraine.

It also demonstrates the opportunities for Russia to attempt to derail this process.

""One thing we shouldn't underestimate is presumably largely Russian propaganda,""

Cramon-Taubadel said.

""If we look at the channels from which some farmers are getting their information, there is much unsubstantiated fear-mongering claiming that imports from Ukraine are depressing prices.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/GettyImages-2191699682.jpg

U.S. President Donald Trump said on June 5 that it might be best not to intervene in Russia’s war against Ukraine for now, speaking during a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz at the White House.

The U.S. president, who has repeatedly claimed he alone can resolve the war, appeared to walk back that promise amid stalled negotiations, rising casualties from Russian drone strikes, and no signs of compromise from either side.

Kyiv has repeatedly urged Russia to accept a Western-backed 30-day ceasefire as the first step toward a broader peace deal — a move that Moscow again rejected during a recent round of negotiations in Istanbul on June 2.

""Sometimes you see two young children fighting like crazy,” Trump said. “They hate each other, and they’re fighting in a park, and you try and pull them apart. They don’t want to be pulled. Sometimes you’re better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart.""

Trump said he used the same comparison during a 75-minute call with Russian President Vladimir Putin the day before, casting himself not as a direct participant but as a referee observing the conflict.

""You see it in hockey. You see it in sports. The referees let them go for a couple of seconds,"" he said. ""Let them go for a little while before you pull them apart.""

Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose sanctions on Russia if he does not see progress in peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow. While he did not name a specific date, he added, ""Yes, it's in my brain the deadline.""

Calling Ukraine ""the apple of Putin’s eye,"" Trump claimed the Russian leader wants to take control of the entire country. Following a reported Ukrainian drone strike on Russian aircraft, Trump said Putin now plans to retaliate.

Ukraine on June 1 launched a game-changing drone attack on four key Russian military airfields, damaging 41 planes, including heavy bombers and rare A-50 spy planes. Kyiv has claimed it had disabled 34% of Russia's strategic bomber fleet in what is seen as one of the most daring operations during the full-scale war.

The operation, dubbed Spiderweb, took 18 months to plan and was overseen directly by President Volodymyr Zelensky and carried out by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). The SBU said 117 drones, launched from concealed trucks positioned across Russian territory, simultaneously struck airfields in at least four regions — including sites thousands of kilometers from the Ukrainian border.

""They went deep into Russia and (Putin) actually told me we have no choice but to attack based on that, and it's probably not going to be pretty,"" Trump said. ""I don't like it, I said don't do it, you shouldn't do it, you should stop it,"" he added.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2213117701.jpg

Russian forces launched high-explosive bombs at the center of Ukraine's southern city of Kherson on June 5, hitting and partially destroying the Regional State Administration building and damaging several surrounding structures.

The entrance to a nearby residential high-rise was also damaged, while other buildings in the area sustained broken windows and facade destruction. The regional prosecutor’s office confirmed that four guided aerial bombs struck the city center.

""Within just fifteen minutes, four Russian bombs hit this location. As a result of the strikes, the building of the Kherson Regional State Administration suffered even greater destruction — it had already been repeatedly targeted by the Russians before,"" Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said via his official Telegram page.

Since Ukraine liberated Kherson in November 2022, Russian forces have continued to target the city with near-daily attacks, aiming at civilian infrastructure, public transport, and residential neighborhoods using a wide array of weaponry.

In addition to the aerial bombardment, Russian troops attacked Kherson with artillery and loitering munitions. According to preliminary reports, at least five apartment buildings, one administrative structure, and an educational institution suffered damage. Local authorities have reported multiple casualties, with three people seeking medical attention following the strikes.

The morning airstrike also damaged a department building of the Kherson City Council, shattering eight office windows. Three educational institutions were hit, with nearly 200 windows blown out.

U.S. President Donald Trump nominated Air Force Lieutenant General Alexus Grynkewich as the next Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) on June 5, reaffirming a key American role in NATO's military structure.

The expected appointment marks a reversal of earlier speculation that the Trump administration was considering relinquishing the U.S. military position, traditionally held by an American four-star general for nearly 75 years.

The role oversees all NATO operations in Europe and is considered one of the alliance's most critical posts. The U.S. has filled the role since its creation after World War II.

Grynkewich, who currently serves as Director for Operations of the Joint Staff, will replace Army General Christopher Cavoli who has been serving in the post since July 2022. His term is expected to start once his nomination is approved in the coming months.

Trump personally informed NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte of the decision, Reuters reported on May 30.

The move is likely to offer short-term reassurance to NATO allies wary of a potential American drawdown. Trump's ""America First"" doctrine has repeatedly cast doubt on the U.S. commitment to multilateral alliances, especially NATO.

In recent years, Trump has questioned whether Washington should defend alliance members that do not meet military spending benchmarks. The comment sparked alarm across Europe, where several countries, including Italy, Canada, and Spain, still fall short of the 2% of GDP goal.

The decision to name a new SACEUR suggests the U.S. will remain engaged in the alliance's military command structure for now, even as Trump continues to push for a rebalancing of defense responsibilities among NATO members. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has repeatedly called on NATO allies to contribute 5% of GDP towards military spending.

5 killed, 9 injured in Russian drone strike on Chernihiv Oblast

Ukrainian forces launched a missile strike on June 5 targeting a concentration of Russian missile troops near the city of Klintsy in Russia’s Bryansk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces reported.

The strike reportedly destroyed one Iskander missile launcher and seriously damaged two others. The targeted unit, part of Russia’s 26th Missile Brigade, had attempted to fire on Ukrainian territory — likely aiming at Kyiv — before it was hit, according to the military.

""Thanks to effective reconnaissance and the coordinated efforts of the Armed Forces and the Security Service of Ukraine, the targets were successfully hit,"" the General Staff said.

The agency added that there were no civilian casualties, and assessments of Russian losses are ongoing.

The Iskander is a short-range ballistic missile system used by Russia for precision strikes against military and infrastructure targets.

With a range of up to 500 kilometers (some 311 miles) and the ability to carry conventional or nuclear warheads, the system remains a key component of Russia's tactical missile forces.

Bryansk Oblast lies just northeast of Ukraine's Chernihiv and Sumy Oblasts, making it one of the key Russian regions bordering northern Ukraine.

The strike came as part of Ukraine's broader effort to degrade Russia's offensive capabilities.

On the same night, Russia launched 103 drones — including Iranian-designed Shahed suicide drones — and one Iskander-M ballistic missile against Ukrainian territory.

Targeting missile assets there may disrupt Russia's ability to launch precision strikes, particularly in advance of an anticipated new summer offensive.

'Deadline is in my brain' — Trump dismisses timeline to impose Russian sanctions

U.S. President Donald Trump sidestepped questions on June 5 as to when he can be expected to impose additional sanctions on Russia, as the Kremlin continues to reject a ceasefire in Ukraine.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose sanctions on Russia if he does not see progress in peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow.

When asked by reporters in the Oval Office as to whether a deadline exists for the implementation of sanction, Trump replied: ""Yes, it's in my brain the deadline,"" without specifying a date.

""When I see the moment where it's not going to stop... we'll be very tough,"" Trump added.

Previously, Trump said he had not yet imposed new sanctions on Russia because he believed a peace deal might be within reach.

""If I think I'm close to getting a deal, I don't want to screw it up by doing that,"" he said, but added he is prepared to act if Moscow stalls further.

On May 28, Trump said that ""It'll take about two weeks, or week and a half,"" to know whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is serious about ending the war in Ukraine, suggesting that sanctions may be on the horizon if efforts are stalled.

Despite two rounds of peace talks in Istanbul, Russia continues to reject a ceasefire in Ukraine.

Following Operation Spiderweb that pre-empted the peace talks, Putin on June 4 blamed Ukraine’s top leadership for the attacks: ""The current Kyiv regime does not need peace at all,"" he said during a televised meeting with senior officials. ""What is there to talk about? How can we negotiate with those who rely on terror?""

Republican Senator Roger Wicker said on June 4 that Trump asked the Senate to delay voting on a bipartisan Russia sanctions bill.

The bill, introduced on April 1 by Senators Lindsey Graham (R) and Richard Blumenthal (D), seeks to impose a 500% tariff on imports from countries that continue purchasing Russian oil and raw materials.

The legislation currently has broad bipartisan support, with 82 out of 100 U.S. senators backing it. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson also voiced his support for the bill.

Trump on June 5 said that he has not yet seen the bipartisan bill.

""I have to take a look. (Senators) are waiting for me to decide what to do. And I will decide. Maybe very soon,"" Trump said. ""But (senators) will be guided by my instructions. That's how it should be.""

'Not destroyed but damaged' — Russia claims it will repair bombers struck in Operation Spiderweb

Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov claimed on June 5 that Russian bombers damaged during Ukraine's Operation Spiderweb will be ""restored,"" adding that the planes were not completely destroyed in the attack.

""The equipment in question, as was also stated by representatives of the Ministry of Defence, was not destroyed but damaged. It will be restored,"" Ryabkov told Russian-state media outlet TASS.

Ukraine on June 1 launched a game-changing drone attack on four key Russian military airfields, damaging 41 planes, including heavy bombers and rare A-50 spy planes. Kyiv has claimed it had disabled 34% of Russia's strategic bomber fleet in what is seen as one of the most daring operations during the full-scale war.

Two U.S. officials told Reuters on June 4 that Ukraine struck as many as 20 Russian military aircraft during Operation Spiderweb, destroying around 10 of them — a claim that stands in contrast with the SBU's estimates.

Independent confirmation of the damage caused is so far limited to satellite images of Belaya air base, which appear to confirm the destruction of at least three Tu-95MS strategic bombers and one Tu-22M3 aircraft, with an additional Tu-95MS visibly damaged.

Another image shows two more likely destroyed Tu-22M3 bombers on the field.

Ryabkov did not specify a timeline as to how quickly the country can allegedly repair the damaged aircraft. In addition to supply-chain challenges brought upon economic sanctions, Russia would also likely face challenges due to the complexities of Soviet-era technology present in the aircraft, if it were to attempt to restore the bombers.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on June 4 that roughly half of the planes damaged will be impossible to repair, while others will require significant time to be put back into service.

During a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on June 4, U.S. President Donald Trump said that Putin vowed that Moscow ""will have to respond"" to the attack.

Russian officials have made few public acknowledgements of the attack. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on June 5 that Moscow will respond when and how the military deems necessary.

Trump privately praises Ukraine's drone strike on Russian bombers as 'badass,' Axios reports

U.S. President Donald Trump privately described Ukraine's drone strike on Russian strategic bombers as ""strong"" and ""badass,"" Axios reported June 5, citing sources familiar with his reaction.

""He thought it was badass,"" one source told Axios.

A second said Trump told a confidant the strike was ""pretty strong.""

One of Trump's advisers reportedly likened the situation to a small but aggressive force managing to hurt a more powerful opponent, using a metaphor about a ""chihuahua"" attacking ""a much bigger dog.""

While Russian propagandists have attempted to downplay the strike, Putin himself has yet to make a public statement.

Operation Spiderweb marks one of the most far-reaching Ukrainian operations of the war and underscores Kyiv's expanding capacity to strike targets far beyond the front lines.

5 killed, 9 injured in Russian drone strike on Chernihiv Oblast



A Russian drone strike on the northern Ukrainian city of Pryluky overnight on June 5 killed at least five civilians, including a one-year-old child, and injured nine others, Ukraine's State Emergency Service reported.

The attack, which hit residential neighborhoods, sparked large fires and left multiple homes in ruins. Chernihiv Oblast Governor Viacheslav Chaus said at least six Iranian-designed Shahed-136 drones were used in the assault.

""Five deaths have been confirmed so far, including two women and a one-year-old child who were found under the rubble,"" Chaus said. ""Police, rescuers, and other emergency services are working at the sites of enemy strikes.""

Emergency crews worked through the night to extinguish the fires. The State Emergency Service said the strike completely destroyed two residential buildings, two garages, a farm building, and a car.

Chaus added that six people were hospitalized and are receiving urgent care. According to the State Emergency Service, a 5-year-old child was injured in the attack.

Pryluky, located in Chernihiv Oblast, lies in northern Ukraine near the border with Russia and Belarus. Before Russia's full-scale invasion, it had a population of roughly 51,500.

The deadly attack is part of a broader campaign of drone and missile strikes by Russia targeting civilian infrastructure across Ukraine.

Ukraine's northern regions, including Chernihiv, have been targeted in recent weeks as Russian forces escalate their air campaign despite mounting international calls for a ceasefire.

Editor's note: This article has been updated to reflect additional comments made by U.S. President Donald Trump on the bipartisan sanctions bill.

U.S. President Donald Trump sidestepped questions on June 5 as to when he can be expected to impose additional sanctions on Russia, as the Kremlin continues to reject a ceasefire in Ukraine.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose sanctions on Russia if he does not see progress in peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow.

When asked by reporters in the Oval Office as to whether a deadline exists for the implementation of sanction, Trump replied: ""Yes, it's in my brain the deadline,"" without specifying a date.

""When I see the moment where it's not going to stop... we'll be very tough,"" Trump added.

Previously, Trump said he had not yet imposed new sanctions on Russia because he believed a peace deal might be within reach.

""If I think I'm close to getting a deal, I don't want to screw it up by doing that,"" he said, but added he is prepared to act if Moscow stalls further.

On May 28, Trump said that ""It'll take about two weeks, or week and a half,"" to know whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is serious about ending the war in Ukraine, suggesting that sanctions may be on the horizon if efforts are stalled.

Despite two rounds of peace talks in Istanbul, Russia continues to reject a ceasefire in Ukraine.

Following Operation Spiderweb that pre-empted the peace talks, Putin on June 4 blamed Ukraine’s top leadership for the attacks: ""The current Kyiv regime does not need peace at all,"" he said during a televised meeting with senior officials. ""What is there to talk about? How can we negotiate with those who rely on terror?""

Republican Senator Roger Wicker said on June 4 that Trump asked the Senate to delay voting on a bipartisan Russia sanctions bill.

The bill, introduced on April 1 by Senators Lindsey Graham (R) and Richard Blumenthal (D), seeks to impose a 500% tariff on imports from countries that continue purchasing Russian oil and raw materials.

The legislation currently has broad bipartisan support, with 82 out of 100 U.S. senators backing it. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson also voiced his support for the bill.

Trump on June 5 said that he has not yet seen the bipartisan bill.

""I have to take a look. (Senators) are waiting for me to decide what to do. And I will decide. Maybe very soon,"" Trump said. ""But (senators) will be guided by my instructions. That's how it should be.""

U.S. President Donald Trump warned on June 5 that Russia's response to Ukraine's Operation Spiderweb is likely ""not going to be pretty,"" following a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin the day prior.

Trump previously said he spoke to Putin over the phone for approximately an hour and 15 minutes on June 4.

""It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate peace. President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields,"" Trump said at the time.

Ukraine on June 1 launched a game-changing drone attack on four key Russian military airfields, damaging 41 planes, including heavy bombers and rare A-50 spy planes. Kyiv has claimed it had disabled 34% of Russia's strategic bomber fleet in what is seen as one of the most daring operations during the full-scale war.

The operation, dubbed Spiderweb, took 18 months to plan and was overseen directly by President Volodymyr Zelensky and carried out by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). The SBU said 117 drones, launched from concealed trucks positioned across Russian territory, simultaneously struck airfields in at least four regions — including sites thousands of kilometers from the Ukrainian border.

""They went deep into Russia and (Putin) actually told me we have no choice but to attack based on that, and it's probably not going to be pretty,"" Trump said.

""I don't like it, I said don't do it, you shouldn't do it, you should stop it,"" Trump added.

Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov claimed on June 5 that Russian bombers damaged during Ukraine's Operation Spiderweb will be ""restored,"" adding that the planes were not completely destroyed in the attack.

Brazilian President Lula da Silva reiterated calls for peace on June 5, urging Russia to restrain attacks on Ukraine as Russian President Vladimir Putin has vowed to ""respond"" to Operation Spiderweb.

Once the playground of disgraced Ukrainian politicians, a golf club in Kyiv’s Soviet-era Obolon neighborhood is now set to become the new campus of the Kyiv School of Economics, which last month bought the site for $18 million as part of a $40 million investment — the largest private investment in education in Ukraine’s independent history.

At the opening picnic on the grounds last Sunday, over 2,000 students, alumni, and locals gathered on a territory once reserved for political elites, including scandal-ridden ex-President Viktor Yanukovych and other similarly shameless officials of his time.

After the 2014 revolution ousted those officials and Ukraine has seen a broader shift toward Europe, the early 2000s golf club — always more about status than love of sport — languished for years.

Starting next year, KSE, one of Ukraine’s top private universities, will reopen the site as a new campus focused on expanding its STEM programs to train engineers, mathematicians, and tech professionals needed for the country’s defense, recovery, and economy. KSE says it has already hired four mathematics professors from abroad to staff the math degree. The campus will also be open to the public.

“This was a closed elite community — we're very capitalist, but we’re going to be socialists on this: Open it,” KSE director Tymofiy Mylovanov tells the Kyiv Independent at the picnic on June 1.

KSE began in the ‘90s with one executive business degree geared toward professionals who wanted to go abroad, and has since grown to 1,500 students across 17 programs — up from 177 students and six programs before the start of the full-scale invasion. The university has quickly outgrown its current building, which it bought in 2020 for $5 million.

KSE’s rector, Tymofii Brik, says the university, using a mix of “pragmatism and romanticism,” bet on Ukraine’s survival against Russia’s full-scale invasion — and its need for engineers to contribute to the war effort and rebuild — by launching new degrees in 2023, a year after the start of the invasion.

Despite the ongoing war, KSE has quickly rolled out new degree programs. (Golf Club Obolon / Facebook)

That year, KSE added programs in psychology, memory studies, law, urban science, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. In 2024, the university launched programs in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and micro and nano-electronics.

The new programs resonated with students who stayed in Ukraine despite the war and wanted to help shape its future, Brik says.

“There’s this expression — ‘If you build a church, they will come.’”

KSE is planning to open the 15,000-square-meter (almost 4 acres, or the size of two soccer fields) grounds to the public and tear down the fences currently separating it from the riverwalk and adjoining public park, taking its inspiration largely from U.S. university campuses. While still small compared to most American universities, it will be the first of its kind in Kyiv. The Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv has an expansive, open campus.

Early conversations with community members, which Brik, who grew up in the area, says the school is committed to engaging in, include an outdoor cinema in the summertime.

“People deserve to have access to this beautiful public space because it belongs to the public — we have no right to close it,” Brik says.

No large land deal in Ukraine is without scrutiny — the results of decades of corruption that have led to public mistrust. KSE’s announcement is no exception. Some critics have said the purchase price was inflated, while others have pointed out that zoning laws do not allow for a campus to be built on the golf course’s grounds, on the riverbank.

Mylovanov and Brik have quick answers to the accusations: On pricing, the buildings on the golf course have far more space than people realize; on zoning, they have no plans to build anything for now, and they will maintain some golf activity to comply with the current laws.

They also point out that, as a U.S.-registered company — it is not uncommon for Ukrainian organizations and companies to be registered abroad — KSE is subject to rigorous compliance checks on any deals they do.

Others have found the wartime investment, in Mylovanov’s words, “cringey.” But for that, too, Mylovanov has a response — first, the school’s donors, made up of confidential individuals and organizations from the U.S., U.K., and Europe, want to invest in education, not the military. And second, while defense is critical, education is also a crucial part of the country’s long-term security.

Looking toward the long-term needs, KSE is partnering with Olin College in the U.S. to co-create a new, interdisciplinary engineering program, says Rebecca Brosseau, who is part of the team developing the new program.

Olin itself was founded 30 years ago on the very idea that traditional engineering curricula weren’t fostering the creative thinking future engineers needed.

Over the next year, Brosseau will recruit around 10 faculty and 10–15 students to launch a pilot program in late 2026, co-developing the curriculum together with the professors, students, and in partnership with Olin.

The goal, Brosseau says, is to build an interdisciplinary team that will design courses collaboratively and try “something completely revolutionary for engineering education and maybe even for higher education — anywhere.”

KSE’s approach is a far cry from Ukraine’s often inefficient, outdated, and even corrupt public education system — a problem of an ingrained culture, not people, says Brik. He believes that at the current moment in Ukraine, only private institutions have the flexibility to drive real reform.

“I would even put it in a very provocative way — if you gave $1 million to a public university right now, nothing would happen; but if you gave $1 million to us or the Ukrainian Catholic University, you would see something meaningful the same year,” Brik says.

When asked whether KSE wants to be a role model for Ukraine’s education system as a whole, Mylovanov says he’s done trying to prove anything to anyone.

“I just want more people in what I call the ‘anti-despair’ movement,” Mylovanov says, to counteract the defeatist narratives “by doing something small, but something real.”",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/101167918_3844681222239923_3595733065294413824_n.jpg

Launched to promote Russian literature on the global stage during Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the new Dar (“Gift”) literary prize is already mired in controversy — and not just for its troubling timing.

After Ukrainian author Maria Galina declined the award for her wartime chronicle of Odesa, attention shifted to shortlisted Russian author Denis Beznosov over his past affiliation with the Russian State Children’s Library — an institution that hosted multiple “cultural” events for abducted Ukrainian children during his time there.

Since the full-scale war began, Ukrainian officials have documented the abduction of nearly 20,000 children by Russian forces. While in Russian territory, these Ukrainian children are subjected to systematic Russification, a deliberate effort to erase their heritage.

Beznosov has rejected the allegations that he was directly involved in any events with abducted Ukrainian children despite his senior role at the Russian State Children’s Library through the first year of the full-scale war, sparking a heated debate within Russia's exiled cultural sphere over the broader issue of societal complicity during wartime.

Can Russian culture exist separate from the war?

Founded in 2025 by exiled Russian author Mikhail Shishkin, the Dar literary prize aims to spotlight Russian-language writers and foster a space where “literature in Russian takes its rightful place in the world, being responsible to humanity, and not to dictatorships.”

Shishkin has lived in Switzerland since 1995 and has long been an outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

At the same time, he has repeatedly called for separating Russian culture from the Russian state. Writing in an op-ed titled “Don’t Blame Dostoevsky” for the Atlantic in 2022, Shishkin expressed the hope that a Ukrainian writer “will speak up for (19th century Russian poet Alexander) Pushkin” whose statues were being dismantled across Ukraine.

While the Dar literary prize was launched by its organizers with the intent to signal that the Russian government does not hold exclusive claim to Russian culture, the initiative has faced criticism for promoting Russian language and culture “regardless of their place of residence and citizenship,” as it states on its website.

“The prize is structured in such a way that, on behalf of dissenting voices, it continues to transmit the official Russian narrative about a borderless Russian culture.”

Critics argue that this approach overlooks the Kremlin’s long-standing use of the Russian language as a tool to suppress Ukrainian and other national identities throughout the region, especially during wartime.

“The prize is structured in such a way that, on behalf of dissenting voices, it continues to transmit the official Russian narrative about a borderless Russian culture,” Ukrainian cultural commentator Bohdana Neborak told the Kyiv Independent.

The one-line biographies omit the authors’ nationalities, making it difficult to differentiate them beyond their shared use of the Russian language — the implication, intentional or not, is that they all might as well be Russian.

“It seeks ways of reconciliation within a dialogue that takes place in a single language but across different countries — thus creating a unified space similar to what is promoted by Russian propaganda. Such a dialogue is impossible, regardless of the goals stated by the prize,” Neborak added.

Ukrainian author Galina, who is among those in the country’s cultural sphere to have distanced themselves from writing in Russian since the full-scale war, was initially named the winner of the Dar literary prize for her book on the war’s impact in Odesa, but declined it.

In an open letter published on the award’s website, she argued that Russian-language literature is not in need of such institutional backing abroad, citing its long-standing role as a successful tool of soft power abroad for Russia.

“Perhaps, when all the funding flows from Russia are finally cut off, Russian literature will eventually take its rightful place among other world literatures,” Galina said.

“And even that — only after it is cleansed of the crimes of the state.”

Speaking to the Kyiv Independent, Galina acknowledged Shishkin’s overall pro-Ukraine stance since Russia’s invasion of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and the annexation of Crimea in 2014.

While she mentioned the sincerity of his intentions in granting the award, Galina also cautioned that the realities of the ongoing full-scale war cast the award in a different light.

“Any attempts to sew the Russophone space are doomed now,” she said.

Shishkin did not reply to the Kyiv Independent’s request for comment.

Russifying abducted Ukrainian children

Amid renewed debate over whether Russian culture can be meaningfully disentangled from the crimes of the Russian state, the Dar literary prize's greatest controversy stemmed from allegations that shortlisted author Beznosov may have been complicit in the state’s forcible deportation of Ukrainian children.

Beznosov served as the deputy director of the Russian State Children’s Library until November 2022, according to his LinkedIn account. However, he wrote in a post on his Facebook on May 29 that he left his position in September 2022 because “the events of 2022” made it impossible for him to continue his work.

During the first year of the full-scale war, the Russian State Children’s Library participated in a number of events involving Ukrainian children displaced by the Russian authorities from Ukraine’s occupied territories.

Photo albums uploaded to the organization’s Flickr page — including one from late March of 2022 titled “Meeting with children who were evacuated from Donbas” at a camp retreat — document the events, which were also covered by local media.

“People involved in crimes against humanity, in the deportation of Ukrainian children from occupied territories, or in the genocide of the Ukrainian people have no place near the Dar literary prize.”

Additional albums uploaded to the Russian State Children’s Library's Flickr account document the Kitovras Festival, which took place in August 2022 in Vladimir, a city located to the east of Moscow.

During the festival, there was an event for abducted Ukrainian children at a local library. Beznosov is photographed at the event, as is Russian children’s book author Andrei Usachev, who has been a vocal supporter of Putin and the war against Ukraine.

In his Facebook post, Beznosov claimed that he had curated the children’s program at the local park that year but denied any involvement in organizing the event for abducted Ukrainian children. He added that he was present at the event because he was “asked to announce the participating writers” in the capacity of his role at the Russian State Children’s Library.

“I had no involvement with the (event with abducted Ukrainian children in Vladimir), have never been to Donbas, and did not compile any guidelines for promoting the Russian language or other similar recommendations. I never received or saw any such materials,” he wrote.

Beznosov did not respond to the Kyiv Independent’s request for comment.

Given the controversy surrounding Beznosov was sparked by his nomination for the Dar literary prize, Shishkin wrote on Facebook that “to what extent Denis Beznosov participated in these crimes — and whether he participated at all — must be determined by (the Ukrainian authorities), not a literary prize.”



“People involved in crimes against humanity, in the deportation of Ukrainian children from occupied territories, or in the genocide of the Ukrainian people have no place near the Dar literary prize.”

Questions of accountability

Beznosov’s professional background came under renewed scrutiny after Galina Rymbu, a Russian writer based in Ukraine, publicly alleged his complicity in the genocide of Ukrainians during his tenure at the Russian State Children’s Library.

In her posts, Rymbu highlighted that a closer examination of the events held by the library revealed that they were part of a larger, deliberate campaign to Russify abducted Ukrainian children.

“These camps (where children are brought) impose propaganda, cultural, educational, literary, and military-patriotic programming designed to erase Ukrainian identity and instill ‘great Russian culture and language,’ with the aim of convincing children they are now ‘Russian,’” Rymbu explained in her initial post.

“Not just the deportation itself, but also these ‘re-education’ camps and the propaganda and ‘cultural’ activities conducted in them are classified as acts of genocide by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe resolution.”

Given the context of the full-scale war, the organization of events with abducted Ukrainian children would have been impossible without direct communication between the Russian State Children’s Library and the Russian security services, Rymbu wrote.

Rymbu also shared in her post a link to the grant application for “The First Book Goes to the Children,” the Russian State Children’s Library’s program associated with “cultural” events involving abducted Ukrainian children.

The application is publicly available on the Russian Presidential Fund for Cultural Initiatives’ website. It is presented as a project dedicated to preserving the “all-Russian cultural identity” and “counteracting the phenomenon of cancel culture.”

The Russian State Children’s Library proposes in the grant application that the ""great Russian culture"" can be a form of ""psychological support"" for Ukrainian children who “relocated” to Russian territory.

""The involvement of highly qualified specialists in children’s reading engagement and child psychologists will help children and teenagers not only connect with great Russian culture through books but also comprehend the foundations of Russia's spiritual and moral code,"" the proposal reads.

“Anyone even remotely connected to Russia’s occupation practices should be considered persona non grata.”

Following Rymbu’s investigative posts, several Russian artists in exile have rallied behind Beznosov, with Russian poet Dmitry Kuzmin even hinting at “provocations orchestrated by Russian security services” behind the issue rather than engaging with the gravity of the allegations levied against Beznosov.

Mikhail Edelstein, a Russian literary scholar who is listed on the expert council of Dar’s website, even went as far to call Rymbu’s posts “disgusting manipulation and clout-chasing.”

According to Russian author Sergei Lebedev, the absence of a clear anti-war, pro-Ukraine position among some members of the Russian literature community in exile reflects a deeper unwillingness to fully confront the scale of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.

“The key problem is that for many Russian cultural figures, Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine started in 2022, not in 2014,” Lebedev told the Kyiv Independent.

“And between 2014 and 2022 lies a gray zone of silence and moral compromises that most participants obviously don't want to look into.

However, Lebedev argues that it’s important to confront those in Russian society who were complicit with Russia’s war against Ukraine, regardless of the scale.

An explosion on a rail line in Russia's Voronezh Oblast on June 5 caused damage to the track and disrupted train travel along the line, regional Governor Alexander Gusev claimed.

The explosion occurred in a remote area between the communities of Yevdakovo and Saguny in Voronezh Oblast.

Gusev claimed that no one was injured in the explosion that immediately disrupted the travel of at least 19 passenger and commercial trains. The explosions was allegedly caused by an improvised explosive device.

The Kyiv Independent cannot verify claims made by Russian officials. The full extent of the damage was not immediately clear.

Russian officials have not yet laid blame publicly as to the cause of the explosion.

Ukraine's intelligence agencies as well as Ukrainian partisan movements have previously been involved in sabotage attacks on Russian railways, disrupting the transport of military cargo toward the front line.

Neither the Ukrainian military nor the partisan movement Atesh commented on the alleged attack.

Ukraine's Military Intelligence Agency (HUR) said Ukrainian drone operators destroyed three Russian fuel tanks during a strike on a train moving through occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia Oblast on May 24.

Russia wants the Vatican to ""take a more active role"" in advocating for what it described as freedom of religion in Ukraine, specifically for members of the Moscow-linked Ukrainian Orthodox Church, the Kremlin said in a statement on June 4 following recent diplomatic contacts.

Russia's war and occupation of large swaths of Ukraine have led to hundreds of churches being damaged or destroyed, dozens of priests killed or kidnapped, and entire religious groups that don't conform to Moscow's brand of Orthodoxy being banned - all while promoting the Kremlin-controlled Russian Orthodox Church.

Sixty-seven clergy members of various faiths have been killed between the start of Russia's all-out war in 2022 and February 2025, the Foreign Ministry said in April, citing the International Religious Freedom or Belief Alliance.

Moscow has also been suppressing independent Ukrainian churches and other religions, including the autocephalous Orthodox Church of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, the Roman Catholic Church, Protestant and Muslim groups, and Jehovah's Witnesses, according to Ukrainian officials.

Putin also noted that ""that the Kyiv regime is banking on escalating the conflict and is carrying out sabotage against civilian infrastructure sites on Russian territory,"" the statement read.

The Kremlin also expressed gratitude to the Pope for the Vatican's readiness to assist in resolving what it called the ""crisis"" (referring to Russia's war against Ukraine) particularly on humanitarian issues handled ""on a depoliticised basis.""

Putin also reportedly noted a progress in recent direct talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials regarding prisoner exchanges and the return of fallen soldiers' bodies.

Pope Leo XIV urged Russia to make ""a gesture that would favor peace "" during the call, according to Vatican News.

Matteo Bruni, director of the Holy See Press Office, said the Pope emphasized ""the importance of dialogue"" and encouraged Moscow to support prisoner exchanges and the return of fallen soldiers' remains.

The Vatican said the Pope and Putin also discussed ongoing humanitarian efforts led by Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, the archbishop of Bologna and papal envoy for Ukraine.

The pontiff reportedly expressed hope that shared Christian values could help promote peace, defend life, and support genuine religious freedom.

The Kyiv Independent's latest documentary ""No God but Theirs"" examines the systematic persecution of Ukrainian Christians in Melitopol — a city in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Oblast, occupied by Russia since February 2022.

The film details how both Protestant and Catholic churches were banned and dispossessed of all property by occupying Russian forces. Clergy were either deported or compelled to flee under threat, while others were falsely accused by Russian propaganda of storing weapons and ammunition. As a result, many members of the religious community were forced to practice their faith in secrecy.

The Kyiv Independent spoke with four Christian leaders from Melitopol: Bishop Dmytro Bodyu of the Pentecostal Church ""Word of Life,"" Father Oleksandr Bohomaz of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, and Pastors Mykhailo Brytsyn and Ihor Ivashchuk of the Baptist Church ""Grace"" whose testimonies provide new details of Russia's targeted repression of Ukrainian Christians.

Slovakia’s parliament passed a resolution on June 5 urging the government to oppose any new international sanctions or trade restrictions against Russia, citing alleged negative economic impacts, Slovak news outlet Noviny reported.

The non-binding resolution argues that the sanctions imposed in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine have driven up energy prices, disrupted supply chains, and harmed Slovak industry.

The resolution calls on government ministers to “defend national economic interests” in international forums and resist further punitive measures targeting Moscow.

The motion was introduced by the far-right Slovak National Party (SNS) and passed with the support of 51 of the 76 lawmakers present.

All SNS deputies backed the measure, along with most members of Prime Minister Robert Fico's left-wing Smer-SD party, several from the coalition partner Hlas-SD, and some independents.

Only one Hlas-SD lawmaker, Jan Ferencak, voted against the resolution; 23 others from the same party abstained. Opposition lawmakers boycotted the vote entirely.

While Fico's Smer party has drawn criticism for its increasingly pro-Russian rhetoric, the SNS promotes a ""pan-Slavic brotherhood"" narrative that aligns closely with Kremlin talking points.

The resolution does not carry legal force but sends a political signal that could complicate Brussels' efforts to maintain consensus on sanctions.

EU foreign policy decisions, including sanctions, require unanimous approval by all member states. A Slovak veto could force concessions or delay enforcement in future rounds.

Since taking office in 2023, Fico has reversed Slovakia's previous pro-Ukraine policy, ending military aid to Kyiv and questioning the value of EU sanctions on Russia.

Russia plans to produce 2 million first-person-view (FPV) drones and 30,000 long-range and decoy drones in 2025 for its war against Ukraine, Ukrainian Foreign Intelligence Service (SZRU) spokesperson Oleh Aleksandrov told Politico on June 5.

The ramp-up marks a critical expansion of Moscow's drone warfare program, as both Ukraine and Russia increasingly rely on unmanned systems for reconnaissance and front-line attacks.

According to Aleksandrov, Russia's drone production is heavily dependent on Chinese components. Despite Beijing's public denials, Chinese manufacturers continue to supply Russia with key electronics and technologies.

""They use so-called shell companies, change names, do everything to avoid being subject to export control and avoid sanctions for their activities,"" Aleksandrov said.

The intelligence official warned that this industrial support allows Moscow to narrow Ukraine's early advantage in drone innovation.

""They aim to produce about 30,000 long-range drones of those types plus 30,000 false target drones they use to exhaust Ukrainian air defenses in 2025,"" he added. ""As for the FPV drones, Russians are aiming to produce a whopping 2 million of them in 2025.""

FPV drones, small and agile devices often equipped with explosive payloads, have proven highly effective in damaging tanks, artillery, and other high-value targets at low cost.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier this year that Moscow is working to manufacture up to 500 long-range drones per day, Suspilne reported.

The Kremlin's nightly drone attacks — frequently involving Iranian-designed Shahed-type drones — have strained Ukraine's air defenses and inflicted heavy damage on cities and infrastructure.

Ukraine, for its part, has dramatically scaled up domestic drone production in response.

The Strategic Industries Ministry reported that Ukraine more than doubled its long-range drone output in 2024 compared to 2023 — a 22-fold increase over 2022.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/DSCF9165.jpg

U.S. President Donald Trump privately described Ukraine's drone strike on Russian strategic bombers as ""strong"" and ""badass,"" Axios reported June 5, citing sources familiar with his reaction.

The operation, carried out by Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) on June 1, targeted four Russian air bases deep inside the country. According to Kyiv, 41 aircraft were struck in the raid, causing an estimated $7 billion in damage.

The targeted bases reportedly housed Tu-95 and Tu-22M3 bombers — long-range platforms frequently used to launch cruise missiles at Ukrainian cities amid Russia's full-scale war. While Trump has remained silent in public about the attack, he reportedly expressed enthusiasm behind closed doors.

""He thought it was badass,"" one source told Axios.

A second said Trump told a confidant the strike was ""pretty strong.""

One of Trump's advisers reportedly likened the situation to a small but aggressive force managing to hurt a more powerful opponent, using a metaphor about a ""chihuahua"" attacking ""a much bigger dog.""

On a TruthSocial post on June 4, Trump confirmed he had discussed the drone attack directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin during a phone call lasting over an hour.

""We discussed the attack on Russia's docked airplanes by Ukraine, and also various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides,"" Trump wrote.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov later confirmed that Putin had informed Trump of Russia's intent to respond to Ukraine's attack, according to state-run media outlet TASS.

U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg earlier warned that the operation could lead to escalation.

""When you attack an opponent's national survival system — their nuclear triad — the risk level goes way up,"" Kellogg told Fox News on June 3.

Ukrainian officials say the drone assault — codenamed Operation Spiderweb — took 18 months to plan. SBU sources claim the attack was carried out using 117 drones launched from trucks inside Russian territory.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the scale of the damage.

While Russian propagandists have attempted to downplay the strike, Putin himself has yet to make a public statement.

A Russian drone strike on the northern Ukrainian city of Pryluky overnight on June 5 killed at least five civilians, including a one-year-old child, and injured nine others, Ukraine's State Emergency Service reported.

The attack, which hit residential neighborhoods, sparked large fires and left multiple homes in ruins. Chernihiv Oblast Governor Viacheslav Chaus said at least six Iranian-designed Shahed-136 drones were used in the assault.

""Five deaths have been confirmed so far, including two women and a one-year-old child who were found under the rubble,"" Chaus said. ""Police, rescuers, and other emergency services are working at the sites of enemy strikes.""

Emergency crews worked through the night to extinguish the fires. The State Emergency Service said the strike completely destroyed two residential buildings, two garages, a farm building, and a car.

Chaus added that six people were hospitalized and are receiving urgent care. According to the State Emergency Service, a 5-year-old child was injured in the attack.

Pryluky, located in Chernihiv Oblast, lies in northern Ukraine near the border with Russia and Belarus. Before Russia's full-scale invasion, it had a population of roughly 51,500.

The deadly attack is part of a broader campaign of drone and missile strikes by Russia targeting civilian infrastructure across Ukraine.

Ukrainian forces launched a missile strike on June 5 targeting a concentration of Russian missile troops near the city of Klintsy in Russia’s Bryansk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces reported.

The strike reportedly destroyed one Iskander missile launcher and seriously damaged two others. The targeted unit, part of Russia’s 26th Missile Brigade, had attempted to fire on Ukrainian territory — likely aiming at Kyiv — before it was hit, according to the military.

""Thanks to effective reconnaissance and the coordinated efforts of the Armed Forces and the Security Service of Ukraine, the targets were successfully hit,"" the General Staff said.

The agency added that there were no civilian casualties, and assessments of Russian losses are ongoing.

The Iskander is a short-range ballistic missile system used by Russia for precision strikes against military and infrastructure targets.

With a range of up to 500 kilometers (some 311 miles) and the ability to carry conventional or nuclear warheads, the system remains a key component of Russia's tactical missile forces.

Bryansk Oblast lies just northeast of Ukraine's Chernihiv and Sumy Oblasts, making it one of the key Russian regions bordering northern Ukraine.

The strike came as part of Ukraine's broader effort to degrade Russia's offensive capabilities.

On the same night, Russia launched 103 drones — including Iranian-designed Shahed suicide drones — and one Iskander-M ballistic missile against Ukrainian territory.

Russian intelligence operatives are impersonating Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) in an expanded effort to recruit Ukrainian civilians for sabotage operations, the SBU said June 5.

The new tactic, described by the agency as a “false flag” operation, involves contacting Ukrainian citizens while posing as SBU officials conducting official inquiries. The SBU said this marks a notable escalation and shift in Russia’s recruitment strategy.

""This is a so-called special operations technique known as 'false flag,' which has not been used by Russian invaders until now, but which they are actively trying to apply now,"" the agency said in a statement.

According to the SBU, targeted individuals typically receive messages via instant messaging apps, instructing them to report to an “SBU investigator” regarding fabricated criminal charges.

That “assistance,” however, comes with strings attached. Victims are pressured into carrying out tasks ranging from surveillance and courier duties to transferring funds. In more serious cases, they are asked to purchase chemicals for explosive devices, set fire to Ukrainian military vehicles or conduct sabotage against government buildings.

""In some cases, Russian curators also demand that malicious software be installed on the victim's phone, allowing them to monitor activity and location in real time,"" the SBU statement said.

While earlier recruitment efforts focused largely on teenagers, the SBU warned that elderly Ukrainians are now increasingly being targeted. The agency said it has disrupted several of these operations in recent weeks but did not provide specific examples.

Air defenses intercepted 74 drones, while another 46 dropped off radars — likely used as decoys to overwhelm Ukrainian systems. The attack was repelled using aviation, electronic warfare units, mobile fire groups, and anti-aircraft missile systems.

Chernihiv Oblast suffered the deadliest strike of the day, where five people were killed and six others wounded after Russian drones struck residential areas in the city of Pryluky, Governor Viacheslav Chaus reported.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reaffirmed his country's full support for Russia's war against Ukraine during a meeting with Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu in Pyongyang, North Korean state news agency KCNA reported on June 5.

Kim reportedly told Shoigu that North Korea ""unconditionally supports the stand of Russia and its foreign policies."" He also emphasized Pyongyang's continued commitment to the 2024 Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement signed with Moscow.

That treaty, signed by Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin on June 19, 2024, commits both countries to provide assistance if either is attacked. Kim previously described the pact as having a “peaceful and defensive nature,” framing it as a formal security guarantee between the longtime partners.

Shoigu, on his second visit to Pyongyang since being appointed secretary of the Russian Security Council, reportedly discussed battlefield developments in Russia's Kursk Oblast, including the role of North Korean soldiers deployed in the region.

According to the Russian Security Council's official readout, the two sides discussed ""perpetuating the memory of the feat of Korean soldiers.""

On June 4, Svyrydenko met in Washington with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and officials from the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), which will serve as the American partner in the fund's management.

""We discussed very concrete steps how to make this fund operational during this year,"" Svyrydenko said in Washington. We plan to have the first board meeting of this fund in July, and we will discuss what will be the seed capital to start operating this fund.""

The Reconstruction Investment Fund will be jointly managed by the DFC and Ukraine's Public-Private Partnerships Agency. While both governments have withheld operational specifics, the fund is expected to serve as a long-term vehicle for Ukraine's postwar recovery.

Kyiv launched the fund on May 23, after months of negotiations that strained ties with Washington. Negotiations led to the removal of controversial provisions Ukrainian officials feared could allow for exploitation of Ukraine's resources.

The Ukrainian parliament approved the necessary amendments to the Budget Code on June 4 to allow for national revenue streams — including rent payments, subsoil permit proceeds, and production-sharing revenues — to be redirected to the fund.

President Volodymyr Zelensky signed the ratified minerals agreement on May 12. Two additional operational agreements were signed on May 13 to facilitate the fund's launch.

Two U.S. officials told Reuters on June 4 that Ukraine struck as many as 20 Russian military aircraft during Operation Spiderweb, destroying around 10 of them.

The claims stands in contrast with estimates made by Ukraine's security service (SBU) which claimed more than 40 aircraft were hit in the June 1 attack.

A source in the SBU told the Kyiv Independent on June 1 that Ukrainian first-person-view (FPV) drones smuggled deep inside Russian and hidden inside trucks has hit 41 Russian heavy bombers at four airfields across the country.

The attacks rendered a significant number of aircraft irreparable, with others expected to take years to restore. The strikes targeted four key airfields—Olenya, Ivanovo, Dyagilevo, and Belaya—used by Russian strategic aviation involved in bombing Ukrainian cities.

The SBU claimed the operation caused approximately $7 billion in damage and disabled one third of Russia's cruise missile bombers.

The Kyiv Independent cannot independently verify the claims made by Ukrainian or U.S. officials.

The SBU on June 4 released new footage from its Operation Spiderweb, showing targeted strikes on Russian strategic aircraft across multiple airfields. From the footage, it is not immediately clear as to how many aircraft were destroyed.

Kyiv did not inform U.S. President Donald Trump about the operation ahead of its execution, and President Volodymyr Zelensky said on June 4 that Ukraine would not have carried out its drone strikes on Russian strategic bombers if Russia had agreed to a ceasefire.

Trump held an hour and 15 minute phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on June 4, which Trump described as a ""good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate peace.""

""President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields,"" Trump added, without making further comments regarding the ""response"" and did not say whether the U.S. had urged restraint.

Trump's Special Envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, warned that the attack could lead to escalations in the full-scale war.

""I'm telling you the risk levels are going way up,"" Kellogg told Fox News on June 3. ""When you attack an opponent's part of their national survival system, which is their nuclear triad, that means your risk level goes up because you don't know what the other side's going to do.""

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is redirecting anti-drone technology earmarked for Ukraine to its own troops based in the Middle East, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on June 4.

According to the WSJ, special fuzes used in ground-to-air rocket systems that protect against drone attacks will be redirected towards units in the Middle East, as the U.S. braces for conflict with Iran as well as Houthi militants in Yemen.

The Pentagon notified Congress last week in a previously undisclosed message that the redirection of the fuzes, used in Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System, was identified by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as an ""urgent issue.""

The fuzes were initially bought for Ukraine by the Biden administration.

The decision comes as Russia has intensified its drone attacks in recent months, targeting cities across Ukraine. On the night of June 1, Russia launched its largest swarm of attack drones since the start of the full-scale invasion, topping out at 472 total units at once.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on June 4 that Russia has launched over 20,000 drones towards Ukraine since the start of 2025.

A source in Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent on June 4 that Russia will soon be able to deploy more than 500 long-range drones a night to attack Ukraine as it ramps up production and builds new launch sites for them.

Since the start of his presidency, Trump has been critical of providing Ukraine with additional military aid. The U.S. temporarily halted military supplies for Ukraine in March before restarting them after Kyiv agreed to the truce plan during talks in Jeddah on March 11.

Hegseth, who reportedly ordered a temporary halt of military aid flights to Ukraine, has also been critical of providing additional aid to Kyiv. Earlier in the day on June 4, Hegseth did not attend a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, marking the first instance since the start of the full-scale war that the U.S. Defense Secretary was not in attendance.

Since Trump's second term began in January, no new aid packages have been approved.

Following a call on June 4 with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump said that Putin ""will have to respond"" to Ukraine's recent drone attack on military airfields.

Ukraine has called upon its partners to invest more in its arms production and to provide additional air defenses, namely Patriot systems, to help fend off intensifying Russian aerial attacks.

Russia launched approximately 48,600 aerial attacks since the start of 2025, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on June 4.

Zelensky said on social media that Russia has launched nearly 27,700 aerial bombs, 11,200 Shahed drones, approximately 9,000 other types of attack drones, and over 700 missiles at Ukraine in 2025.

Russia has intensified its aerial attacks in recent months, targeting Ukrainian cities with missiles and drones. On the night of June 1, Russia launched its largest swarm of attack drones since the start of the full-scale invasion, topping out at 472 total units at once.

For three consecutive days over May 24-26, Russia launched one of the heaviest attacks of the war to date with a series of mass drone and missile attacks at Ukrainian cities, during which more than 600 drones and dozens of missiles were launched.

The significant uptick in attacks comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has sought to mediate peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. Despite two rounds of negotiations, Russia has continued to reject a ceasefire.

""Russia has restructured its entire state, society, and economy to be able to kill people in other countries on a massive scale and with impunity,"" Zelensky added. ""It means, that with every new strike, with every delay of diplomacy, Russia is giving the finger to the entire world — to all those who still hesitate to increase pressure on it.""

A source in Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent on June 4 that Russia will soon be able to deploy more than 500 long-range drones a night to attack Ukraine as it ramps up production and builds new launch sites for them.

U.S. President Donald Trump has asked the Senate to delay voting on a bipartisan Russia sanctions bill, Republican Senator Roger Wicker said on June 4.

""I know that he (Trump) asked the leader (Senate Majority Leader John Thune) not to bring the bill to a vote this week,"" Wicker said during a meeting of the Defense Writers Group in Washington.

The bill, introduced on April 1 by Senators Lindsey Graham (R) and Richard Blumenthal (D), seeks to impose a 500% tariff on imports from countries that continue purchasing Russian oil and raw materials.

Its aim is to tighten economic pressure on Russia and discourage third-party nations from enabling the Kremlin’s energy exports.

The legislation currently has broad bipartisan support, with 82 out of 100 U.S. senators backing it. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson also voiced his support for the bill.

Previously, Trump said he had not yet imposed new sanctions on Russia because he believed a peace deal might be within reach.

""If I think I'm close to getting a deal, I don't want to screw it up by doing that,"" he said on May 28, but added he is prepared to act if Moscow stalls further.

Russia aims to deploy 10,000 troops to Transnistria and install a pro-Kremlin government in Moldova to enable it, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean told the Financial Times in an interview published June 4.

“They want to consolidate their military presence in the Transnistrian region,” Recean said, adding that Russia’s goal is to increase leverage not only near Ukraine’s southwest but also close to NATO member Romania.

Although Russia has maintained a limited military presence in Transnistria since the 1990s, only 1,000-1,500 troops remain today.

“Currently, their forces there are almost meaningless,” Recean noted.

However, he warned that a Russia-leaning government in Chisinau could authorize a buildup, citing Moldovan intelligence estimates for the 10,000-troop target.

Recean accused Russia of meddling in Moldova’s upcoming parliamentary elections through propaganda, illegal financing, and “spending the equivalent of 1% of Moldova’s GDP” on influence operations in 2024.

He said Moldovan authorities had intercepted citizens carrying large sums of Russian cash and discovered that 130,000 voters in the previous election received money from Russian sources.

“This is a huge effort to undermine Moldovan democracy,” Recean said, affirming that Moldova remains committed to becoming an EU member.”

The Kremlin has not publicly responded to these allegations.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a briefing on June 4 that he may consider allowing the creation of private armies in Ukraine.

His comment came as a reaction to one of the points in the latest Russian memorandum, which calls for Ukraine to eliminate “nationalist formations” and private military companies.

“I will now start thinking about it after such ultimatums,” Zelensky said.

Zelensky emphasized that Ukraine currently has no private armed groups under its law, noting, “If they are talking about ‘Azov,’ it is the National Guard of Ukraine.”

He contrasted Ukraine’s military structure with Russia’s use of private forces and mercenary groups like Wagner, highlighting the double standards.

“They (Russia) have ‘Wagner’ and it is true. They admit it, they admit that they have private military formations that we destroyed,” Zelensky said.

According to a document leaked after the second round of talks with Ukraine, Russia’s demands also include Ukraine's neutral status, a ban on the country's NATO bid and other possible military alliances, and an official end to Western arms supplies and intelligence sharing with Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir Putin did not mention Ukraine’s recent drone strikes that destroyed dozens of Russian strategic bombers during a lengthy televised cabinet meeting on June 4 — despite the attack marking one of the most significant blows to Russia’s military infrastructure since the start of the full-scale war.

The strikes, part of Ukraine’s covert Operation Spiderweb, were carried out on June 1 using first-person-view (FPV) drones that had been smuggled into Russia and hidden in trucks. The drones successfully targeted four major airfields — Olenya, Ivanovo, Dyagilevo, and Belaya — used by Russia’s long-range aviation fleet, responsible for regular missile attacks on Ukrainian cities.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) confirmed that 41 aircraft were hit, including heavy bombers and rare A-50 spy planes, causing an estimated $7 billion in damage. Many of the bombers were destroyed beyond repair, while others may take years to restore. President Volodymyr Zelensky and SBU chief Vasyl Maliuk personally oversaw the operation.

On June 4, the SBU released high-resolution footage of the strikes, highlighting the precision and scale of the operation.

On June 4, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov acknowledged the incident, saying Putin had been informed and that Russia’s Investigative Committee had launched a probe. “The president received information about the incident online,” Peskov told reporters. “There was also a corresponding statement from the Defense Ministry.”

Despite the scale of the attack, Putin avoided addressing the matter during his first public appearance following the strikes. Instead, he focused on other incidents, including a railway bridge bombing that killed at least seven and injured over 100 people in the Bryansk region, which he blamed on Ukraine.

The Kremlin’s silence stands in stark contrast to celebrations in Kyiv, where Zelensky called the operation “brilliant” and said it dealt “significant losses — entirely justified and deserved.”

In the meantime, Russian forces are attempting to downplay the scale of losses to their strategic aviation following Operation Spiderweb by replacing damaged aircraft with intact ones, a source in SBU told the Kyiv Independent.

After the operation, Moscow has been trying to obscure the true extent of its losses. According to the SBU source, the Russian military is bringing undamaged planes to the airfields to replace the destroyed ones so that satellite imagery does not show the burned-out aircraft.

Editor's Note: This story is being updated.

Russian President Vladimir Putin ""will have to respond"" to Ukraine's recent drone attack on military airfields, U.S. President Donald Trump said on June 4 after holding a call with the Russian president.

Trump said he spoke to Putin over the phone for approximately an hour and 15 minutes on June 4.

""We discussed the attack on Russia's docked airplanes, by Ukraine, and also various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social account after the call.

""It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate peace. President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields.""

Trump made no further comments regarding the ""response"" and did not say whether the U.S. had urged restraint.

Ukraine on June 1 launched a game-changing drone attack on four key Russian military airfields, damaging 41 planes, including heavy bombers and rare A-50 spy planes.

The operation, dubbed Spiderweb, took 18 months to plan and was overseen directly by President Volodymyr Zelensky and carried out by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). The SBU said 117 drones, launched from concealed trucks positioned across Russian territory, simultaneously struck airfields in at least four regions — including sites thousands of kilometers from the Ukrainian border.

The Kremlin was initially quiet about the operation. Days after the attack, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on June 3 said that Putin had been informed of the ""incident"" and that an investigation had been launched.

Trump was also uncharacteristically silent about the attack, which was hailed in Ukraine as a major success. The White House confirmed on June 3 that Ukraine did not inform Trump in advance about the operation.

Trump's Special Envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, warned that the attack could lead to escalations in the full-scale war.

""I'm telling you the risk levels are going way up,"" Kellogg told Fox News on June 3. ""When you attack an opponent's part of their national survival system, which is their nuclear triad, that means your risk level goes up because you don't know what the other side's going to do.""

Ukraine's drone strike followed several days of Russian escalation as Moscow launched some of the heaviest aerial attacks in the full-scale war over a span of three nights. Operation Spiderweb targeted some of the very bombers that rained destruction on Ukrainian cities and civilian targets.

Zelensky said on June 4 that Ukraine would not have carried out the attack on Russia's airfields if Moscow had agreed to the many proposals for a ceasefire put forth since March.

Operation Spiderweb struck Russia the day before the second round of direct peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow took place in Istanbul on June 2. The U.S. has praised the talks as a sign of Trump's successful intervention in the peace process — even though Russia continues to reject a ceasefire.

Putin said on June 4 that Russia was no longer interested in negotiating with Ukraine.

""The current Kyiv regime does not need peace at all,"" he said during a televised meeting with senior officials. ""What is there to talk about? How can we negotiate with those who rely on terror?""

Despite the Kremlin's persistent refusal to impose a ceasefire or make significant steps towards peace, Trump has not followed through on threats to sanction Russia. While Republican lawmakers, including staunch Trump allies, have rallied around legislation sanctioning Russia, Trump has shied away from pressuring Moscow.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2205276244.jpg

Key developments on June 4:

Ukraine hacks Russia's Tupolev bomber producer, source claims

Putin's 'disregard' for troops highlighted as Russian losses approach 1 million, study finds

Ukraine expects to exchange 500 POWs in next swap with Russia, Zelensky says

Russia strikes Ukrainian military training facility in Poltava Oblast, military says

Kremlin confirms explosion at Crimean Bridge after Ukraine's sabotage, claims 'no damage'

Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) has gained access to sensitive data of Russia's strategic aircraft manufacturer Tupolev, a source in HUR told the Kyiv Independent on June 4.

Tupolev, a Soviet-era aerospace firm now fully integrated into Russia's defense-industrial complex, has been under international sanctions since 2022 for its role in Russia's war against Ukraine. Its bombers have been widely used to launch long-range cruise missiles against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.

According to the source, HUR's cyber corps accessed over 4.4 gigabytes (GB) of internal data, including official correspondence, personnel files, home addresses, resumes, purchase records, and closed meeting minutes.

""The significance of the data obtained cannot be overestimated,"" the source said. ""Now, in fact, there is nothing secret left in Tupolev's activities for Ukrainian intelligence.""

The intelligence includes detailed information about engineers and staff responsible for maintaining Russia's strategic bombers, such as the Tu-95 and Tu-160, which form a key part of Russia's nuclear triad.

""In particular, we have obtained comprehensive information about individuals directly involved in servicing Russian strategic aviation,"" the source added. ""The result will obviously be noticeable both on the ground and in the sky.""

Ukrainian cyber operatives also replaced the Tupolev website's homepage with an image of an owl clutching a Russian aircraft, likely referencing HUR's insignia and cyber warfare skills.

The source shared excerpts of internal data obtained during the breach, including what appeared to be internal documents and personnel files of staff, as proof. The combination of physical strikes on Russia's strategic aviation and now the exposure of its internal architecture marks a significant blow to Moscow's long-range aerial warfare.

Putin's 'disregard' for troops highlighted as Russian losses approach 1 million, study finds

Russian military casualties in Ukraine are approaching 1 million and are likely to surpass that figure by summer 2025, according to a new report by the U.S.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) published on June 3.

The total number of military casualties on both sides is nearing 1.4 million, including approximately 400,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed or injured.

The think tank estimates that more than 950,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Of those, as many as 250,000 have died on the battlefield — losses CSIS says underscore Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ""blatant disregard"" for his forces.

Despite its staggering losses, Russia continues to rely on mass wave assaults. According to CSIS, this approach has allowed Russian forces to capture less than 1% of Ukrainian territory since January 2024, often advancing by only 50 meters per day.

The cost in equipment has also been severe. According to the think tank, Russian losses across land, air, and sea domains have vastly outpaced Ukraine’s, with some battlefield loss ratios reaching 5:1.

As of June 4, Ukraine’s General Staff put Russia’s cumulative troop losses at 991,820. While Kyiv does not disclose its own casualty numbers, Ukraine’s Armed Forces report Russian losses on a daily basis.

The full human toll remains difficult to confirm due to the opacity on both sides. CSIS used estimates compiled from U.S. and U.K. defense officials, as well as satellite imagery and battlefield assessments.

Independent Russian outlet Mediazona and the BBC Russian service have confirmed the identities of at least 109,625 Russian troops killed, based on open-source data such as obituaries, local news, and social media posts.

Russia’s monthly recruitment ranges from 30,000 to 40,000 new soldiers, Western intelligence officials told the Wall Street Journal in April. Rather than announce another mass mobilization, the Kremlin has relied heavily on financial incentives, offering lucrative contracts to new recruits.

Ukraine expects to exchange 500 POWs in next swap with Russia, Zelensky says

Ukraine plans to bring home a total of 500 prisoners of war (POW) from Russian captivity in an exchange with Russia between June 7 and 8, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a meeting with journalists on June 4 attended by the Kyiv Independent.

""Today, our teams held consultations on exchanges. The Russian side has informed us that this weekend, on Saturday and Sunday, it will be able to transfer 500 people, our military personnel, out of the 1,000+ that we agreed on,"" Zelensky said.

The upcoming swap follows a major 1,000-for-1,000 exchange carried out between May 23 and 25. That deal, initially reached during Istanbul talks on May 16, was the largest prisoner exchange of the war so far.

The new exchange was agreed upon during the second round of direct talks held on June 2.

Zelensky said that Ukraine has not yet received the list of names for the upcoming swap, but that Moscow had promised to provide it in advance.

""This time, unlike in Istanbul last time, the Russians have promised to give us the lists of whom we are exchanging in advance, which is important for us,"" he noted.

The statement comes as a previous prisoner exchange list reportedly included Anatolii Taranenko, a Ukrainian service member accused of collaborating with Russia.

Taranenko's alleged inclusion in the exchange exacerbated criticism that Ukraine failed to secure the release of any Azov fighters and many civilians who had been held captive by Russia for years in what was the largest prisoner swap of the full-scale war.

After the June 2 talks, Russia also pledged to transfer 6,000 bodies of fallen Ukrainian soldiers and officers to Ukraine. Zelensky noted that preparations for exchanging the bodies will begin after the POW swap.

Ukraine has consistently pushed for an ""all-for-all"" formula in prisoner swaps, aiming to secure the return of every Ukrainian soldier in captivity. Russia has rejected that proposal.

Russia strikes Ukrainian military training facility in Poltava Oblast, military says

Russia launched a missile attack against a military training facility in Poltava Oblast on June 4, resulting in injuries among the personnel, the Ground Forces' press service reported.

""Thanks to timely and carefully planned security measures... the worst has been avoided,"" the press service said, saying that no soldiers have been killed in the attack against the central region, which lies about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Kyiv.

The strike follows a string of Russian attacks against Ukrainian military facilities across Ukraine.

A deadly missile strike on a training camp in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast on June 1 killed at least 12 soldiers and led to the resignation of then-Ground Forces Commander Mykhailo Drapatyi, who was later appointed the commander of the Joint Forces.

The casualties sustained in Russian attacks deep in the rear sparked backlash, with military leadership facing criticism for failing to provide adequate security for soldiers and recruits.

Security protocols, including dispersal of personnel and the use of shelters, ""saved the lives of service members who were at the training facility at the time of the strike"" on June 4, the Ground Force said.

""Unfortunately, there are wounded. All victims are receiving care in specialized medical institutions."" The press service did not specify the number of victims or the exact location of the targeted military facility.

A special commission has been established to clarify the circumstances of the attack and the resulting damage, according to the statement.

Kremlin confirms explosion at Crimean Bridge after Ukraine's sabotage, claims 'no damage'

An explosion recently occurred at the Crimean Bridge, but caused ""no damage,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed on June 4, accusing Ukraine of attempted attacks on Russia's infrastructure.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed responsibility for the explosion that rocked the bridge in the early hours of June 3. The agency said that more than a ton of explosives in TNT equivalent damaged the underwater supports of the structure.

""There indeed was an explosion. There was no damage, the bridge continues to function,"" Peskov said, according to the Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti. ""Kyiv continues in its attempts to attack infrastructure facilities.""

Constructed after Russia’s illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014, the Crimean Bridge — also known as the Kerch Bridge — is a critical supply and transport route for Russian forces to the occupied Ukrainian territories. It connects the occupied peninsula to Russia's Krasnodar Krai via the Kerch Strait.

The Russian state media reported on June 3 that a ""Ukrainian intelligence agent"" who had constructed a bomb on ""orders from Kyiv"" had been detained by Russia's FSB.

In comments later on June 3, Dmytro Pletenchuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Navy, said the ""key and most complex"" part of the bridge had been damaged in the attack.

The operation, which follows the SBU's mass drone strike against Russia's strategic aviation on June 1, was personally supervised by the agency's chief, Vasyl Maliuk.

The bridge suffered significant damage during two previous Ukrainian attacks in October 2022 and July 2023, though neither managed to take the bridge out of commission.

In the video, Russian activist Anna Kiryakova reads from a book of poetry that glorifies her country’s war against Ukraine. The anthology’s title — “Poetry of the Russian Winter” — is written with the Latin Z in place of its Russian analog.

The inclusion of that one letter aligns the book with the Kremlin’s pro-war narrative. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Z has become a pro-war symbol that many Ukrainians and opponents of the invasion equate with the Nazi swastika.

The most shocking thing about the recording was the location. Kiryakova read the poem inside the Russian Cultural Center in Washington, D.C.

The poem in question was written by a Russian war correspondent and included in the book at the behest of Margarita Simonyan, one of the Kremlin’s most notorious propagandists.

The video was published by Russian state television this February, as the U.S. was negotiating with Russia in a bid to end the war, which has taken the lives of tens of thousands of Ukrainians since 2022.

This bizarre occurrence — a Russian activist reading pro-Russian war poetry in the heart of a country that says it wants to stop the war — is emblematic of the work of the vast global network of Russian Centers for Culture and Science, more commonly known as Russia Houses.

Officially, Russian Houses are intended to promote Russia’s culture, language, and, more importantly, its vision of the world. Their activities range from hosting poetry readings and film screenings to awarding scholarships to Russian universities and organizing fully-funded trips to Russia.

Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, they have faced growing scrutiny for serving as a vehicle for propaganda, disinformation and, as some allege, espionage.

But closing them down has proved to be a tall order for Western governments.

Despite European Union sanctions against their parent entity, Russian House continues its activities in Brussels, Berlin, Paris, Rome, Madrid, Luxemburg, Vienna, Prague, Warsaw, Budapest, Chisinau, Bratislava, and other capitals.

In a new investigation, the Kyiv Independent attempted to uncover why these centers of Kremlin soft power often seem immune to sanctions and political concerns about Russian malign influence.

We found that the Russian Houses frequently exist in a legal gray area, shielded by diplomatic immunity and deliberate efforts to obfuscate their connection to the parent entity.

""I think it's never been recognized as a significant threat,"" Dmitry Valuev, president of the U.S. organization Russian America for Democracy in Russia, told the Kyiv Independent.

In Washington, several incidents have shown that “their activities are malign and damaging to the security and national interests of the United States,” he added, but this has only led American law enforcement to investigate specific individuals, not the organization itself.

According to the parent entity, Russian international cooperation agency Rossotrudnichestvo, Russian House currently has a presence in 71 countries around the world.

Staying afloat

On Feb. 13, the government of Moldova announced that it would be closing the Russian Center for Science and Culture in Chisinau.

The night before, Russian drones had violated the country’s airspace and struck its territory during an attack on Ukraine.

Moldova, which borders Ukraine, is no stranger to Russian aggression and influence. Since the early 1990s, the eastern part of its territory, known as Transnistria, has been occupied by an unrecognized separatist statelet backed by Moscow.

But, almost four months after the Moldovan government’s announcement, Russian House continues to conduct business as usual in Chisinau.

The reasons behind this highlight how difficult it can be to shut down Russian Houses, even when a government appears committed to doing so.

Legally, the Russian Centers for Science and Culture are something of a mystery.

They operate globally based on intergovernmental agreements signed between Russia and the host country. Each document differs slightly, but the general model allows each signatory to establish a cultural and scientific center in the other country.

Despite that official foundation, Russian Houses regularly lack local registration as legal entities. Their directors are often employed at the local Russian embassy, which grants them diplomatic immunity.

As a result, one won’t find the Russian Center for Science and Culture in Chisinau officially registered in Moldova. The same goes for the centers in Berlin and Washington.

The now defunct Russian House in Kyiv also never had legal registration — despite the fact that the Ukraine-Russia intergovernmental agreement, signed in 1998, explicitly required Russia to legally register the center in Ukraine. (At least in some places, including in Berlin and Washington, D.C., the buildings used by Russian House belong directly to the Russian government).

Today, that lack of registration allows Russian Houses to deny that they have a connection to parent entity Rossotrudnichestvo, which the EU sanctioned in 2022 as a conduit for Kremlin influence and propaganda abroad.

“In the European Union there are no representative offices of Rossotrudnichestvo, but (there are) independently operating cultural centers — Russian Houses,” Rossotrudnichestvo head Yevgeny Primakov told Russian state information agency TASS in May 2024.

But the connection between the two entities is not difficult to find.

Prior to the EU sanctions, the websites of the Russian Houses in Berlin and Paris each listed Rossotrudnichestvo as their parent organization. An archived version of the Washington center’s website from July 2022 states that it is “subordinate” to the agency.

Participants of the global Russian language campaign “Total Dictation” hold the Soviet Victory Banner at the Russian Cultural Center in Washington, D.C., on April 25, 2025. (Russian Cultural Center in Washington, D.C.)

Moreover, Rossotrudnichestvo is explicitly mentioned in bilateral agreements as an organization that oversees and ensures the operation of Russian Houses. Such language was included in the agreement signed between Russia and Germany. The agreement with Moldova is similar, but lists a previous name of the parent agency.

European sanctions froze all assets owned by Rossotrudnichestvo inside the EU and banned any financial or economic support for the organization. As representative offices of Rossotrudnichestvo, Russian Houses would presumably be unable to operate or cover their expenses within the EU.

Instead, many of them continue to operate, insisting they are “independent.”

The centers’ lack of registration also raises another question: Do they have official bank accounts or do they make payments in cash off the books?

In 2016, when Russian House still operated in Kyiv, Ukrainian journalists inquired about its status with the Ukrainian State Fiscal Service. But the tax authorities were unable to find any official bank accounts for the organization inside Ukraine.

A rare description of how Russian House carries out financial transactions came from Pavel Izvolsky, the head of the center in Berlin. It was still quite vague.

“We have certain procedures for processing online payments,” he told Deutsche Welle in 2023.

Currently, sanctions make it exceedingly difficult for Russia to conduct bank transactions with EU and U.S. entities.

In a written response to the Kyiv Independent, Olof Gill, spokesperson for the European Commission’s financial services department, said that EU Member States are responsible for implementing sanctions, identifying breaches, and imposing penalties through their national authorities.

Gill did not comment on whether Rossotrudnichestvo’s continued connection to Russian House constitutes a sanctions violation.

Nadia Koval, co-author of a Ukrainian Institute study on Rossotrudnichestvo, told the Kyiv Independent that sanctions can restrict Russian House’s ability to make payments and cooperate with local organizations. But that has its limits.

“Tough action by the host countries is required,” she said.

Diplomatic immunity and Russian espionage

In 2023, after the EU imposed sanctions on Rossotrudnichestvo, the Berlin public prosecutor’s office attempted just that kind of ""tough action.""

It launched a criminal probe to determine whether Russian House’s activities violated the German Foreign Trade and Payments Act.

But prosecutors were forced to close the investigation into Izvolsky — the Russian House director had diplomatic immunity.

That abortive attempt at reining in the center emphasized another aspect of Russian House: its ties to the embassy.

According to bilateral agreements, Rossotrudnichestvo is not the only organization supervising it. The Russian diplomatic mission also plays a key role.

It’s a common practice for the heads of the Russian Houses to be employed at the Russian embassy. Their deputies can also be diplomats, according to the agreements with Moldova, Germany, and the U.S.

That means diplomatic immunity protects them from arrest and prosecution in the host country.

Dr. Patrick Heinemann, a German lawyer specializing in constitutional law, told the Kyiv Independent that a broader criminal investigation into the center nonetheless continues, and it may focus on the activities of other Russian House employees, as well as third parties doing business with it.

Heinemann also noted that Germany’s new Central Office for Sanctions Enforcement is conducting a parallel investigation into Russian House under regulatory law.

“However, nothing about these investigations is being made public,” he said. “The authorities are evading press inquiries on the grounds that the investigations must not be jeopardized.”

Diplomatic immunity can also facilitate espionage activities, and employees of Russian Houses in multiple countries have fallen under suspicion of working for Russian intelligence agencies.

That happened twice at Russian House in Washington, D.C.

In 2018, the Trump administration expelled Oleg Zhiganov, then the director of the Russian Cultural Center in Washington, D.C. The U.S. government said he was an intelligence officer operating under diplomatic cover and part of a group that engaged in “aggressive intelligence collection.”

His predecessor, Yury Zaytsev, apparently also came under suspicion. U.S. media reported that the FBI determined he was involved in compiling dossiers on Americans who took part in cultural exchange trips to Russia and could later be cultivated as intelligence assets.

He reportedly left the U.S. after the FBI investigation started.

It didn’t stop his diplomatic work. Zaytsev became director of the Russian House in Nicosia and later held the same position in Vienna.

That wasn’t the only instance in which Russia House was implicated in espionage.

The Danish newspaper Information reported that Russian House in Copenhagen was a favored gathering place for Russian embassy employees later identified as spies. The cultural center built close ties with Danish research institutions, most notably with the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). It even hosted joint conferences, seminars, and other events with the university, Information reported.

Aleksey Nikiforov, a DTU researcher who frequently attended Russian House events, was later sentenced to three years in prison for, among other things, collecting intelligence on green technology from DTU and SerEnergy, a company based in Denmark’s far north. Prosecutors said he passed the information on to a Russian intelligence service in exchange for payment.

The independent Russian investigative outlet The Insider has also reported that the head of Russian House in Berlin Pavel Izvolsky was once registered as residing in a dormitory of the Moscow Higher Military Command School (MVVKU), an institution known for training cadets for the SVR and the GRU, another Russian intelligence agency.

Izvolsky did not respond to requests for comment.

In Moldova, the fate of Russian House still in the air To halt the activities of the Russian House in Chisinau, Moldova decided to terminate the intergovernmental agreement with Russia that allows the Russian Cultural Center to operate in the country. ""Once the termination procedures are completed, the Russian Cultural Center will cease its activities in our country,"" the Moldovan foreign ministry said in a statement. But ending the agreement has taken a while. The Moldovan culture ministry told the Kyiv Independent that it had prepared draft legislation to terminate the agreement and it was now up to Parliament to pass it. But the bill has not yet been put to a vote. Dragos Galbur, head of the National Moldavian Party (PNM), has been calling for the center’s closure for over two years. He warns that it serves as a tool for Russification and propaganda within Moldova, similar to the tactics Russia employed in Ukraine. Galbur notes that, as long as there is no parliamentary decision, the Russian House in Moldova continues to hold events in the country. “They go into schools, hold these bizarre so-called ‘open lessons’ with kids, telling them Russia is Moldova’s friend, that the Soviet Union was a great power, and that we’re all its children,” he told the Kyiv Independent. Galbur believes Parliament could have resolved the issue swiftly. With today’s pro-European majority, “they could vote in 15 minutes”, he said. But he thinks they fear backlash from pro-Russian voters — an important electoral group ahead of the September 2025 parliamentary elections. A lack of political will may also explain why some EU countries have failed to close down Russian Houses. According to Deutsche Welle, the German authorities may fear that the Russian government could retaliate by closing the Goethe Center in Russia. German lawyer Heinemann, who is well acquainted with the case, also believes this explanation. He notes that, although Russian House directors enjoy diplomatic immunity, they can still be declared persona non grata and expelled from Germany if they commit a criminal offense. But that has not happened to the Russian House director in Berlin.

Creative solutions

Not all countries have hesitated to close down Russian Houses. Several — including EU members — have taken decisive action.

Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Denmark, the UK, Romania, and Azerbaijan have all shut down or suspended the operations of their Russian Houses.

Notably, none of these moves appear to be directly based on EU sanctions against Rossotrudnichestvo. Instead, the countries have gotten creative.

In Denmark, authorities initially tried to freeze Russian House’s funds. But that didn’t stop its activities. The Center finally closed its doors after the Danish government expelled five Russian diplomats and 20 embassy administrative staff from the country.

While their names have never been made public, the Russian House director was presumably among them.

“They forced us to leave,” the Сenter wrote in its final Facebook post, noting that Russian House cannot operate without a director.

Romania acted similarly. In early 2023, the Romanian foreign ministry set a six-months deadline for Russian House in Bucharest to shut down. A few weeks before the deadline, Romania expelled 40 Russian embassy staff, forcing Russian House to suspend its operations.

(A similar tactic failed in Moldova. In August 2023, Moldova expelled the head of the Russian House in Chisinau along with 44 Russian diplomats, after The Insider reported on an espionage case involving antennas mounted on the roof of the Russian Embassy. Shortly thereafter, Russia replaced him with a new acting director Artyom Naumenkov and Russian House continued its work.

The Kyiv Independent tried to contact Naumenkov, but he declined our call, did not respond to the written questions and later hid his profile photos on Telegram.)

Meanwhile, Azerbaijan swiftly shuttered the Russian House in Baku after a Russian air defense system shot down an Azerbaijani passenger plane, killing 38 people.

Amid deteriorating relations with Moscow, the Azerbaijani foreign ministry used the fact that Russian House was not registered as a legal entity to demand that it cease operations. Azerbaijan also required the center to vacate its building within a month and a half because the property was set to be sold.

The Russian House in London simply never reopened after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Rossotrudnichestvo representative in the U.K. was denied a visa, leaving the сenter inactive.

In Ukraine, efforts to close the Russian House in Kyiv were delayed for several years because Parliament needed to pass legislation terminating the intergovernmental agreement with Russia.

Finally, in 2021, the government imposed sanctions on Rossotrudnichestvo. That shut down the center’s activities without a parliamentary decision.

But unlike Ukraine and many countries in Europe, the U.S. has not closed down Russian House or imposed sanctions on Rossotrudnichestvo. After a 1.5-year pause, the Russian Cultural Center in Washington resumed its activities in December 2022.

The center had no issue holding celebrations marking the anniversary of Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea and has done so twice since 2022.

It continues to demonstratively glorify Russian military aggression while the Trump administration tries to negotiate peace. While some of its visitors are members of the Russian diaspora, its events also attract Americans without connections to Russia.

They include a handful of highly involved Americans from business, cultural circles, and academia, as well as philanthropists — some of whom were among the first to sponsor the Russian House at the time of its founding. They also formed the nonprofit Friends of the Russian Cultural Center to help raise funds for the Russian House and support the building’s renovation in the late 1990s.

Supporters of the center have portrayed it as a benign cultural initiative aimed at promoting understanding between Russians and Americans. But not everyone agrees.

Activist Valuev says that the Russian Cultural Center’s main goals include building connections and shaping U.S. public opinion in favor of the Kremlin.

“Businesses, religious groups, churches, cultural programs, education, exchange programs — all of it is used and weaponized by the Russian government,” he said. “It’s not a question of whether they use it. They do.”

Benchmarks and soft commitments with the IMF



Think tanks urge government to launch customs reform as IMF deadline approaches

Key Ukrainian economic NGOs and think tanks are calling on the Cabinet of Ministers to form a selection commission for the head of the State Customs Service, as mandated by law.

Despite legal obligations and commitments to international partners, the government has yet to move forward with the process, which has remained on hold for five months. Failure to complete the appointment process could jeopardize Ukraine’s International Monetary Fund benchmarks.

Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko recently said the full-scale invasion by Russia had changed the reform’s context, and that broader structural changes are needed.

Ukrainian Government misses legal deadline for budget declaration approval

The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has yet to approve the country’s medium-term Budget Declaration, despite a legal requirement to adopt the document by June 1. As of June 2, the document had neither been approved by the government nor registered in parliament. This marks the second consecutive year in which the deadline has been missed, despite the requirement being reinstated at the request of the Finance Ministry itself.

Customs-like delays nearly hit state audit reform, but parliament finally receives candidate list

Nearly a month after receiving names of international experts for the Accounting Chamber selection process, the Ukrainian government finally transmitted them to parliament. A six-member selection board will now be formed to launch the competition for new members of the Accounting Chamber.

Ukraine to restrict foreign currency bond sales to exchanges starting June 30

Starting June 30, Ukrainian investors will no longer be able to purchase government-issued FX-denominated domestic bonds (OVDPs) outside of licensed exchanges. The decision, adopted by the National Securities and Stock Market Commission, aligns with IMF requirements aimed at tightening capital controls and aligning financial company operations with banking regulations.

While the move is intended to curb currency manipulation by exporters, market participants warn it may complicate operations for institutional investors and dampen budget revenue flows. Monthly trade volumes for such instruments average $464 million and 200 million euros, according to the National Bank of Ukraine.

Obligations to the EU

ARMA reform bill pulled from parliament’s agenda once again

Ukraine’s delayed Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA) reform has suffered another setback, as the draft law #12374-d was once again removed from this week’s legislative agenda.

The bill, which aims to overhaul ARMA, was expected to be considered in second reading. The bill — originally scheduled for a March deadline under the Ukraine Facility program — is a critical condition for unlocking part of the 12.5 billion euros in EU funding allocated to Ukraine in 2025.

The Verkhovna Rada also postponed President Zelensky’s alternative draft law #13268, focused narrowly on the management of Russian-linked assets. The legislation has drawn criticism for lacking comprehensive institutional reform.

As we reported in Issue 27, this week the parliament is set to vote on several other bills which are benchmarks for the Ukraine Facility and the IMF’s program. Among those are draft law #13165 and alternatives on improving judicial integrity declarations; draft law #12377 on establishing the fundamentals of national housing policy; draft law #9363 on the digitalization of enforcement proceedings; draft law #13018-d on financial inclusion.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/GettyImages-2212755824.jpg

Editor’s Note: The following is the latest in a series of reports by the Kyiv Independent about the memorialization of Ukraine’s fallen soldiers.

""We weren’t taught to live side-by-side with death in schools and universities, but it's always near,"" the speaker Anton Liahusha, the dean of the memory studies program in the Kyiv School of Economics, says during a lecture at the open-air Lviv folk museum.

On June 1, thousands of Ukrainians gathered to celebrate the 27th birthday of a fallen military medic and memorialization activist, Iryna ‘Cheka’ Tsybukh.

They listened to lectures about memorial culture in Ukraine, shopped for traditional and hand-made items, donated to the combat medic unit Tsybukh served in, Hospitallers, danced folk dances to live Ukrainian music, and sang Ukrainian songs around a bonfire.

Promoting the values Tsybukh cared for in life, the “Cheka fest” festival is a striking example of the new ways Ukrainians are honoring those killed in Russia’s war, as old commemoration customs fail to hold the weight of continuous losses.

The woman of the day was also at the festival as a large black-and-white portrait placed next to the stage. Tsybukh was killed during a front-line mission in Kharkiv Oblast in 2024 just days before her 26th birthday.

Before her death, Tsybukh was a fierce advocate for the reinvention of memorial practices in Ukraine, recording several interviews with Ukrainian media and widely sharing her views on social media.

The festival — named after Tsybukh’s callsign and organized for the first time this year by her family, friends, and fellow activists — included both educational and musical programs.

How to love their loved ones after they were killed?

Before noon, hundreds of people had filled the lush green yard near one of the museum’s traditional Ukrainian wooden architectural buildings.

People sat on the grass and chairs, while others that hadn’t managed to get a seat lined the fence and gate. They listened to lectures about memorial culture that aimed to put the incomprehensible into words: How to love their loved ones after they were killed?

When the losses are so overwhelming, talking and remembering them together helped people share their weight, Tsybukh believed.

Her own family and comrades on the stage recounted stories of how she lived out her patriotic values, becoming a “a moral compass” to many of the young people who didn’t know her personally.

“Stories about Iryna inspire, give you the strength to move on,” said Kateryna Borysenko, 31, a psychotherapist in training who survived 1.5 years in occupation in her native Donetsk Oblast. “They give hope that, however much the heavens would fall, we’ll live on.”

“I have made it my duty to attend every event like this, connected with the war, with heroes, with soldiers,” said Khrystyna Martsiniak, 21, a journalism student studying at the same Lviv university that Tsybukh graduated from. “I also was (at Iryna Tsybukh’s grave) at 9 a.m. today. It was something special.”

The daily minute of silence at 9 a.m. to honor fallen soldiers was a staple of Tsybukh’s memorial culture philosophy. She believed that if observed everywhere in the country, it had the power to unite Ukrainians in their shared loss.

“Stories about Iryna inspire, give you the strength to move on.”

Tsybukh’s belief in unity in the face of loss was so deep she designed her own funeral as a sort of memorial concert to bring people together in mourning. In a posthumous letter published by her brother, she outlined her wishes for the funeral, which included a request people to wear traditional Ukrainian garments — embroidered shirts called “vyshyvanka” — and sing ten Ukrainian songs around the fire in her memory.

The second musical part of the festival proved that Tsybukh’s vision lives and expands, and is emerging as a new tradition. Thousands of people dressed in vyshyvankas covered the slope of a hill around the festival stage, where Ukrainian bands played the songs she loved. Hundreds danced as Tsybukh’s family watched from afar.

When dusk fell, people approached the stage to honor Tsybukh the way she wished: by collectively singing in Ukrainian.

It seemed like the moment everyone was waiting for all day. From the stage, a short recording of Tsybukh’s voice was played on a phone into the microphone.

“A most soulful evening awaits each of you tonight,” Tsybukh voice says from a recording taken during a concert she helped to organize for soldiers near the front.

Her voice and her legacy echoed again in many hearts, as ten Ukrainian songs from her list filled the evening museum park.

As the festival came to a close that evening, Tsybukh’s friends and family promised to celebrate her birthday with a festival again next year. The remaining people gathered around the glowing embers of the fire to sing one last song — the Ukrainian national anthem.

Maria Voskoboinyk, 28, who didn't know Tsybukh personally but came from Kyiv specially for the memorial festival, said she left the event with a sense of duty fulfilled.

""I came here to see my beacon,"" she said, referring to Tsybukh, as she walked from the park through the dark streets with several other young women.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/Smolienko_June-01_-08.jpg
https://kyivindependent.com/putin-casts-doubt-on-peace-talks-accuses-ukraine-of-deadly-bridge-attack-in-russia/,"Putin rejects Zelensky’s call for peace talks, accuses Ukraine of deadly bridge attack in Russia","The Kyiv Independent, Olena Goncharova",2025-06-04T15:01:00+00:00,"This audio is created with AI assistance

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on June 4 questioned the value of ongoing peace talks with Ukraine, accusing Kyiv of orchestrating deadly attacks on infrastructure in Russia that killed seven people and injured 115 others.

Two bridges in Russia’s Bryansk and Kursk regions collapsed overnight on May 31 in what Russian authorities have described as terrorist attacks.

Putin blamed Ukraine’s top leadership for the attacks: ""The current Kyiv regime does not need peace at all,"" he said during a televised meeting with senior officials. ""What is there to talk about? How can we negotiate with those who rely on terror?""

He added that the attacks showed Kyiv is ""degenerating into a terrorist organisation, and its sponsors are becoming accomplices of terrorists.""

Putin’s remarks signaled that Russia has no plans to declare an immediate ceasefire or agree to a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky — two key demands put forward by Ukraine during June 2 peace talks.

According to Russian investigators, a bridge in Bryansk region was blown up overnight on May 31 just as a passenger train carrying 388 people passed underneath. A second bridge in Kursk was also reportedly targeted. The explosions occurred just days before Ukraine and Russia met in Turkey the latest round of negotiations.

Bryansk Oblast, located in Russia's far-west, borders Ukraine's Chernihiv and Sumy Oblast, and has been the target of various Ukrainian strikes.

Putin also de-facto rejected the idea of a full ceasefire in Ukraine, arguing that any pause in fighting would allow Kyiv to regroup and rearm with Western weapons.

Ukraine has been calling for an immediate and unconditional 30-day truce, presenting its latest proposal during peace talks in Istanbul on June 2.

""Why reward them by giving them a break from the combat, which will be used to pump the regime with Western arms, to continue their forced mobilization and to prepare different terrorist attacks,"" Putin said during a televised government meeting.

During the Istanbul talks, Russia proposed a temporary two- to three-day ceasefire in specific areas of the front line to allow for the retrieval of fallen soldiers' bodies, Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky said on June 2.

Zelensky criticized Russia’s proposal for a 2–3-day local ceasefire to retrieve the bodies of fallen soldiers, speaking during an online press conference attended by the Kyiv Independent.

""They just don’t see a ceasefire as such at the moment,"" Zelensky said of Russia's proposal. ""As they said regarding a ceasefire, they are ready for a 2–3-day ceasefire to retrieve the dead from the battlefield. I think they’re idiots, because, fundamentally, a ceasefire is meant so that there are no dead.""

Putin said the Ukraine's position ""does not surprise us"" and added that ""power for (Kyiv), apparently, is more important than peace and than the lives of people whom they apparently do not consider their own.""

During the cabinet meeting, Putin never mentioned Ukraine’s recent drone strikes that destroyed dozens of Russian strategic bombers — despite the attack marking one of the most significant blows to Russia’s military infrastructure since the start of the full-scale war.



The strikes, part of Ukraine’s covert Operation Spiderweb, were carried out on June 1 using first-person-view (FPV) drones that had been smuggled into Russia and hidden in trucks. The drones successfully targeted four major airfields — Olenya, Ivanovo, Dyagilevo, and Belaya — used by Russia’s long-range aviation fleet, responsible for regular missile attacks on Ukrainian cities.

Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) on June 4 released a new footage from its Operation Spiderweb, showing targeted strikes on Russian strategic aircraft across multiple airfields.

On June 1, the SBU conducted an operation using first-person-view (FPV) drones that were smuggled deep inside Russia and concealed in trucks, successfully striking 41 Russian heavy bombers and causing an estimated $7 billion in damage.

The attacks rendered a significant number of aircraft irreparable, with others expected to take years to restore. The strikes targeted four key airfields—Olenya, Ivanovo, Dyagilevo, and Belaya—used by Russian strategic aviation involved in bombing Ukrainian cities.

President Volodymyr Zelensky and SBU Chief Vasyl Malyuk personally oversaw the operation.

On the evening of June 1, Zelensky described the operation as ""brilliant,"" adding that Russia suffered ""significant losses — entirely justified and deserved.""

The operation damaged or destroyed a range of aircraft, including A-50 surveillance planes, Tu-95, Tu-22, and Tu-160 bombers, as well as An-12 and Il-78 transport and refueling aircraft.

Zelensky said Ukraine would not have carried out its drone strikes on Russian strategic bombers if Russia had agreed to a ceasefire. Speaking at a June 4 meeting with journalists attended by the Kyiv Independent, Zelensky linked the operation to Moscow’s rejection of a truce.

Kyiv has consistently pushed for a Western-backed 30-day ceasefire as an initial step toward a broader peace agreement. However, during the latest round of negotiations in Istanbul on June 2, Russia once again declined the proposal.

Ukraine plans to bring home a total of 500 prisoners of war (POW) from Russian captivity in an exchange with Russia between June 7 and 8, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a meeting with journalists on June 4 attended by the Kyiv Independent.

""Today, our teams held consultations on exchanges. The Russian side has informed us that this weekend, on Saturday and Sunday, it will be able to transfer 500 people, our military personnel, out of the 1,000+ that we agreed on,"" Zelensky said.

The upcoming swap follows a major 1,000-for-1,000 exchange carried out between May 23 and 25. That deal, initially reached during Istanbul talks on May 16, was the largest prisoner exchange of the war so far.

The new exchange was agreed upon during the second round of direct talks held on June 2.

Zelensky said that Ukraine has not yet received the list of names for the upcoming swap, but that Moscow had promised to provide it in advance.

""This time, unlike in Istanbul last time, the Russians have promised to give us the lists of whom we are exchanging in advance, which is important for us,"" he noted.

The statement comes as a previous prisoner exchange list reportedly included Anatolii Taranenko, a Ukrainian service member accused of collaborating with Russia.

Taranenko's alleged inclusion in the exchange exacerbated criticism that Ukraine failed to secure the release of any Azov fighters and many civilians who had been held captive by Russia for years in what was the largest prisoner swap of the full-scale war.

After the June 2 talks, Russia also pledged to transfer 6,000 bodies of fallen Ukrainian soldiers and officers to Ukraine. Zelensky noted that preparations for exchanging the bodies will begin after the POW swap.

Ukraine has consistently pushed for an ""all-for-all"" formula in prisoner swaps, aiming to secure the return of every Ukrainian soldier in captivity. Russia has rejected that proposal.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/photo_2025-05-06_14-29-58.jpg

Russia will soon be able to deploy more than 500 long-range drones a night to attack Ukraine as it ramps up production and builds new launch sites for them, a source in Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) has told the Kyiv Independent.

According to the source, Russia's production rate for one type of drone — Shahed-type Gerans — is up to 70 units per day, from a reported 21 a day last year, and Moscow will soon have 12-15 new launch sites in operation.

Three of these were identified by Ukrainian media in March, the remaining have not been previously reported.

Only three are still under construction, with the others already in the process of becoming operational, the source said.

Until recently, Russian launches have depended on just five launch sites: Kursk, the port towns of Yeysk and Primorsko-Akhtarsk in Krasnodar Krai, and two sites in occupied Crimea, Cape Fiolent and Cape Chauda.

Currently, Russia’s drone swarms have topped out at 472 total units at once, a record set on the night of June 1. After the new launch sites are completed, and with drone production numbers increasing, they will be able to send over 500 in a single attack, the source said.

Russian production is ramping up to accommodate this, according to Kyiv. Last month President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia was aiming to produce 500 long-range drones of various types a day.

The source in HUR said at present, Russia makes upwards of 70 Geran drones per day, over 2,100 a month..

CNN found that for the first nine months of 2024, Russia was producing an average of roughly 21 per day, or just 640 per month.

But Gerans only make up a part of the total number of drones that Russia regularly launches at Ukraine.

Almost all of Russia’s deep-strike drones are divided into three similar varieties — Iranian-made imported Shaheds, which have been in use since late 2022, Russian-made Gerans, which are direct copies of Shaheds, and more recently Garpiya-A1s, which look similar but use Chinese parts.

The source did not give any information on the numbers of Shaheds Russia is importing from Iran or the number of Garpiya-A1s that it is producing.

There are also inexpensive ""dummy drones,"" or Gerbers, which resemble Shaheds but do not carry explosives.

Those drones distract Ukrainian radar and anti-aircraft fire and typically make up half of the drones sent into Ukraine in a given attack, a Ukrainian mobile defense group that shoots them down told the Kyiv Independent.

Data from the Ukrainian Air Force and compiled by KI Insights show a massive uptick in Russian drone launches into Ukraine since the latter half of 2024.

Their effectiveness — those neither shot down nor lost en route to the targets — has increased over the past six months due to modifications to the drones themselves, as well as how they are deployed.

An increasing number of new Russian-made deep-strike drones are being equipped with jet engines, allowing them to carry heavier payloads at higher speeds and altitudes.

Production of domestic first-person view, or FPV, drones is also up in the Russian military, which the HUR source says is trying to raise annual production from the current figure of 1.5 million to 1.8-2 million by next year.

Ukraine plans to produce 4.5 million FPV drones in 2025 after making 1.5 million in 2024.

Russian military casualties in Ukraine are approaching 1 million and are likely to surpass that figure by summer 2025, according to a new report by the U.S.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) published on June 3.

The total number of military casualties on both sides is nearing 1.4 million, including approximately 400,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed or injured.

The think tank estimates that more than 950,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Of those, as many as 250,000 have died on the battlefield — losses CSIS says underscore Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ""blatant disregard"" for his forces.

Despite its staggering losses, Russia continues to rely on mass wave assaults. According to CSIS, this approach has allowed Russian forces to capture less than 1% of Ukrainian territory since January 2024, often advancing by only 50 meters per day.

The cost in equipment has also been severe. According to the think tank, Russian losses across land, air, and sea domains have vastly outpaced Ukraine’s, with some battlefield loss ratios reaching 5:1.

As of June 4, Ukraine’s General Staff put Russia’s cumulative troop losses at 991,820. While Kyiv does not disclose its own casualty numbers, Ukraine’s Armed Forces report Russian losses on a daily basis.

The full human toll remains difficult to confirm due to the opacity on both sides. CSIS used estimates compiled from U.S. and U.K. defense officials, as well as satellite imagery and battlefield assessments.

Independent Russian outlet Mediazona and the BBC Russian service have confirmed the identities of at least 109,625 Russian troops killed, based on open-source data such as obituaries, local news, and social media posts.

Russia’s monthly recruitment ranges from 30,000 to 40,000 new soldiers, Western intelligence officials told the Wall Street Journal in April. Rather than announce another mass mobilization, the Kremlin has relied heavily on financial incentives, offering lucrative contracts to new recruits.

Ukraine would not have launched its drone strike on Russian strategic bombers if Moscow had accepted Kyiv's calls for a ceasefire, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a June 4 meeting with journalists attended by the Kyiv Independent.

Kyiv has repeatedly urged Russia to accept a Western-backed 30-day ceasefire as the first step toward a broader peace deal — a move that Moscow again rejected during a recent round of negotiations in Istanbul on June 2.

""If there had been a ceasefire, would the operation have taken place? No,"" Zelensky said when asked about the massive June 1 drone operation, codenamed Operation Spiderweb.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed responsibility for the strike, which reportedly hit 41 Russian military aircraft and caused an estimated $7 billion in damage.

Zelensky added that roughly half of the planes will be impossible to repair, while others will require significant time to be put back into service.

When asked about a potential reaction from U.S. President Donald Trump, Zelensky said he was unaware of any public comment.

Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, acknowledged that the strike demonstrated Ukraine was ""not lying down,"" but he warned it could escalate the war further. The U.S. president has not yet commented on the strike.

""We should choose the game rules,"" Zelensky said, underscoring that Ukraine would continue to respond as long as Russia carries out attacks against Ukrainian territory.

The SBU said 117 drones, launched from trucks hidden across Russia, struck four different Russian air bases, some of them thousands of kilometers from the Russia-Ukraine border.

The targeted facilities reportedly housed Tu-95 and Tu-22M3 bombers, essential carriers of long-range cruise missiles used in Moscow's air strikes on Ukrainian cities.

Talking about the recent peace talks, Zelensky dismissed Russia's engagement as ""artificial diplomacy,"" calling the ""peace memorandum"" it presented an ""ultimatum."" He noted that there is no sense in continuing negotiations with lower-level Russian delegates, calling instead for a meeting with Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Russia used the talks to list its peace conditions, which reportedly included official recognition of Russia's occupation of Ukrainian territories, Ukraine's full withdrawal from four partially occupied regions, a ban on joining NATO, limits on the military, and other demands.

Like the first round of talks on May 16, this week's negotiations ended without any tangible progress toward a long-term ceasefire or a peace deal. Instead, the two parties agreed on a new prisoner exchange, which could involve up to 1,200 prisoners on each side.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/GettyImages-2217918638.jpg

Russia launched a missile attack against a military training facility in Poltava Oblast on June 4, resulting in injuries among the personnel, the Ground Forces' press service reported.

""Thanks to timely and carefully planned security measures... the worst has been avoided,"" the press service said, saying that no soldiers have been killed in the attack against the central region, which lies about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Kyiv.

The strike follows a string of Russian attacks against Ukrainian military facilities across Ukraine.

A deadly missile strike on a training camp in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast on June 1 killed at least 12 soldiers and led to the resignation of then-Ground Forces Commander Mykhailo Drapatyi, who was later appointed the commander of the Joint Forces.

The casualties sustained in Russian attacks deep in the rear sparked backlash, with military leadership facing criticism for failing to provide adequate security for soldiers and recruits.

Security protocols, including dispersal of personnel and the use of shelters, ""saved the lives of service members who were at the training facility at the time of the strike"" on June 4, the Ground Force said.

""Unfortunately, there are wounded. All victims are receiving care in specialized medical institutions."" The press service did not specify the number of victims or the exact location of the targeted military facility.

Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) has gained access to sensitive data of Russia's strategic aircraft manufacturer Tupolev, a source in HUR told the Kyiv Independent on June 4.

Tupolev, a Soviet-era aerospace firm now fully integrated into Russia's defense-industrial complex, has been under international sanctions since 2022 for its role in Russia's war against Ukraine.

Its bombers have been widely used to launch long-range cruise missiles against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.

According to the source, HUR's cyber corps accessed over 4.4 gigabytes (GB) of internal data, including official correspondence, personnel files, home addresses, resumes, purchase records, and closed meeting minutes.

""The significance of the data obtained cannot be overestimated,"" the source said. ""Now, in fact, there is nothing secret left in Tupolev's activities for Ukrainian intelligence.""

The intelligence includes detailed information about engineers and staff responsible for maintaining Russia's strategic bombers, such as the Tu-95 and Tu-160, which form a key part of Russia's nuclear triad.

""In particular, we have obtained comprehensive information about individuals directly involved in servicing Russian strategic aviation,"" the source added. ""The result will obviously be noticeable both on the ground and in the sky.""

Ukrainian cyber operatives also replaced the Tupolev website's homepage with an image of an owl clutching a Russian aircraft, likely referencing HUR's insignia and cyber warfare skills.

The breach comes days after the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) crippled over a third of Russia's strategic bomber fleet in a major drone operation codenamed Spiderweb, which targeted four Russian air bases.

That attack reportedly damaged 41 aircraft, including Tu-95 and Tu-22M3 bombers, using drones launched from trucks hidden deep inside Russian territory.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the number of aircraft reportedly hit by the SBU or some of the claims regarding the cyberattack.

The source shared excerpts of internal data obtained during the breach, including what appeared to be internal documents and personnel files of staff, as proof.

The U.S. administration has not yet made any new decisions on military assistance for Kyiv as it remains focused on ending the Russia-Ukraine war, U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker told journalists on June 4.

Whitaker stressed that Washington counts on European leadership in providing Ukraine with the resources needed to achieve a lasting peace, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.

The envoy made the comments as Kyiv's partners gathered in Brussels for a Ramstein-format summit of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG).

The UDCG was initially launched by former U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in 2022 to coordinate assistance for Ukraine among some 50 countries.

Pete Hegseth, the current Pentagon chief, relinquished chairmanship of the group to the U.K. and Germany and opted out of the June 4 meeting, leaving Whitaker to represent the U.S.

Since taking office in January, U.S. President Donald Trump has not approved any new defense aid for Ukraine, vowing instead to broker a swift peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow.

The assistance approved under the previous Biden administration continues to flow, but is expected to run out in the coming months. Washington also provides Ukraine with crucial intelligence assistance.

As peace talks stall, Trump has signaled the U.S. might abandon its involvement in the effort, raising fears among European partners that he might also cut off all remaining support for Ukraine.

The U.S. president has repeatedly urged Europe to take up responsibility for backing Ukraine and for its own security as his strategic focus shifts away from the continent.

Ukraine's parliament approved key amendments to the Budget Code on June 4 to implement the landmark minerals agreement with the United States, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak announced.

The legislation, supported by 309 members of parliament, enshrines financial provisions critical to executing the U.S.-Ukraine deal signed on April 30 and ratified by Kyiv on May 8.

The agreement grants the U.S. special access to strategic mineral development projects in Ukraine, including lithium, titanium, and rare earth elements vital to defense, aerospace, and green energy industries.

The approved changes require Ukraine to contribute 50% of revenues from several sources to the fund. These include rent payments for mineral extraction from new licenses, fees from new subsoil use permits, and proceeds from state production shares under new production-sharing agreements.

The funds will be collected in a dedicated budget account and transferred to the Reconstruction Investment Fund at the discretion of the fund's chief administrator. The fund will be co-managed by Ukraine and the U.S. under an equal partnership model.

Washington will be represented by the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), while Kyiv will be represented by Ukraine's Public-Private Partnerships Agency.

The agreement marks a new phase in U.S.-Ukraine economic cooperation and has been months in the making. Protracted negotiations led to the removal of controversial provisions that Ukrainian officials feared could allow for exploitation of Ukraine's natural resources.

Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said in April that future U.S. military aid could be counted as contributions to the fund, though previously allocated assistance will not apply.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1398149194.jpg

Ukraine's recent drone strike against Russian bombers was a show of ""skill and audacity"" comparable to the U.S. operation to kill Osama bin Laden, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal told Politico in an interview published on June 3.

The Operation Spiderweb, conducted by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on June 1, reportedly hit 41 bomber planes and other aircraft, inflicting what Kyiv claims is $7 billion in damage and disabling over a third of Russia's strategic bomber fleet.

""Just in the skill and audacity of these attacks, it will rank with the United States raid on Osama bin Laden and the Israeli pager operation as one of the great military achievements in recent years,"" Blumenthal said, adding that Ukraine ""can hit anywhere.""

The SBU said 117 drones, launched from concealed trucks positioned across Russian territory, simultaneously struck airfields in at least four regions — including sites thousands of kilometers from the Ukrainian border.

The targeted air bases reportedly housed Tu-95 and Tu-22M3 bombers, essential carriers of long-range cruise missiles used in Moscow's air strikes on Ukrainian cities.

Bin Laden, the late leader of the al-Qaeda terror group responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the U.S., was killed by U.S. special forces at his compound in Pakistan on May 2, 2011.

Blumenthal, a Democratic lawmaker, and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham are co-sponsors of a new bill that would impose additional sanctions on Russia as it continues to reject a ceasefire.

The lawmakers are meeting a Ukrainian delegation—including Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak—in Washington this week to discuss sanctions and defense cooperation with the U.S.

According to Blumenthal, battlefield successes could help convince U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been reluctant to impose fresh sanctions, to take the step.

Trump is yet to comment on the Ukrainian operation, while the White House confirmed he was not informed about it in advance.

An explosion recently occurred at the Crimean Bridge, but caused ""no damage,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed on June 4, accusing Ukraine of attempted attacks on Russia's infrastructure.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed responsibility for the explosion that rocked the bridge in the early hours of June 3. The agency said that more than a ton of explosives in TNT equivalent damaged the underwater supports of the structure.

""There indeed was an explosion. There was no damage, the bridge continues to function,"" Peskov said, according to the Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti. ""Kyiv continues in its attempts to attack infrastructure facilities.""

France and Belgium are not ready to accept the European Commission's latest proposal to phase out Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG), calling for additional assurances, Politico reported on June 3.

The two nations, the largest EU importers of Russian LNG, argue they need stronger legal and economic guarantees before committing to the plan. Russia's energy exports remain a major source of revenue for the Kremlin's military campaign against Ukraine.

The Commission's proposal, unveiled on May 6, outlines a roadmap to end the bloc's dependence on Russian fossil fuels — gas, oil, and nuclear — by 2027.

Although the EU has slashed its reliance on Russian gas from 45% in 2021 to 19% in early 2025, several key member states remain cautious about cutting LNG ties entirely.

French Energy Minister Marc Ferracci told Politico that Paris supports diversification but prefers to prioritize securing replacement supplies.

France has been sourcing alternative LNG from Qatar and other suppliers, but it remains bound to long-term contracts with Russian firms.

""The stock of existing contracts… needs to be legally protected,"" Ferracci said.

France's TotalEnergies, which owns a 20% stake in the Yamal LNG project in Siberia, has a supply contract with Russia's Novatek valid through 2032.

Belgium, Europe's second-largest Russian LNG customer, is seeking an ""in-depth impact assessment"" before backing the Commission's plan.

Belgian Energy Minister Mathieu Bihet said Brussels must evaluate how ending imports would affect its LNG terminals and storage infrastructure, which are expected to handle Russian shipments until 2035.

The cautious stance by France and Belgium diverges from that of Spain and the Netherlands, who have both expressed readiness to endorse the Commission's strategy.

Ukrainian officials and civil society groups have consistently urged the EU to cut these financial lifelines, pointing to the ongoing Russian attacks and occupation.

The Commission's proposed cutoff forms part of a broader push to safeguard European energy sovereignty and reinforce the EU's sanctions architecture.

Editor's note: This story has been updated to include Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson's statement and reporting by RFE/RL.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will not attend the June 4 meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG), the Associated Press (AP) reported, citing a U.S. official.

The news agency reported that Hegseth will not arrive in Brussels until the conference is over and will not participate in the event online either. This will be the first meeting of Kyiv’s roughly 50 military backers in the so-called Ramstein format that the Pentagon chief will not attend.

According to Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson, Hegseth's travel schedule precluded attendance at the meeting.

""The United States is focused on ending the war in Ukraine as quickly as possible, on terms that establish an enduring peace,"" she added.

The U.S. will instead be represented by its ambassador to NATO, Matthew Whitaker, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. Hegseth will also not be present at the NATO-Ukraine Council meeting on June 5, according to the outlet's sources.

The U.K. and Germany will chair the June 4 meeting, which will take place as Russia continues to reject a ceasefire and reportedly prepares new offensives against Ukraine.

Ukraine has called upon its partners to invest more in its arms production and to provide additional air defenses, namely Patriot systems, to help fend off intensifying Russian aerial attacks.

Hegseth's predecessor, former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, launched the UDCG after the outbreak of Russia's full-scale war in 2022 to coordinate assistance among Kyiv's allies.

The last Ramstein-format UDCG meeting took place in Brussels on April 11 under the chairmanship of London and Berlin, with allies committing more than 21 billion euros ($23.8 billion) in long-term military aid to Ukraine.

Hegseth attended the Ramstein summit on Feb. 12, but not as its chairman, a position held by Austin until then. His British counterpart, John Healey, presided over the summit instead. Previous reporting suggested that the defense secretary was to skip the April meeting, but he eventually joined via video link.

Since taking office in January, U.S. President Donald Trump has begun scaling down the U.S. presence in various international pro-Ukraine initiatives as he seeks to broker a ceasefire and a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow.

A fire broke out on June 4 at the Avtodizel motor plant in Yaroslavl, one of Russia's largest producers of diesel engines and a supplier to the Russian military, the Moscow Times reported, citing regional emergency officials.

Located roughly 280 kilometers (174 miles) northeast of Moscow, the Yaroslavl Motor Plant has been under U.S. sanctions since May 2024. The U.S. Treasury Department cited the facility's role in supplying engines for military equipment used in Russia's war against Ukraine.

The blaze engulfed a 400-square-meter workshop where 12-cylinder engines are manufactured. It took firefighters more than 90 minutes to extinguish the open flames, according to Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry.

No casualties were reported. The cause of the fire has not been disclosed.

This is the second major fire at a Russian engine plant in two days. On June 2, a blast and fire tore through a workshop at the Zavolzhsky Motor Plant in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast.

Local authorities said the cause was a tanker truck fire in a facility storing chemicals. That plant produces gasoline and diesel engines for civilian and military vehicles.

Ukraine has not commented on the Yaroslavl fire. Kyiv has escalated its campaign to strike military-industrial targets inside Russia as Moscow continues to reject calls for a ceasefire and expand its aerial assault on Ukrainian cities.

Ukrainian drone attacks in recent weeks have forced repeated shutdowns of Russian airports and struck military airfields and logistics hubs across Russia and occupied parts of Ukraine.

Russian authorities have not accused Ukraine of involvement in the fires, but the incidents come amid a broader pattern of unexplained industrial accidents and infrastructure damage inside Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/GettyImages-622847108.jpg

U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on June 3 to double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, raising duties from 25% to 50%, the White House announced.

Trump's new order builds on a Feb. 10 executive action that imposed a flat 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports. Steel production is one of Ukraine's core industrial sectors and its second-largest source of foreign currency after agriculture.

The White House cited the earlier rate's failure to ""develop and maintain the rates of capacity production utilization that are necessary for the industries' sustained health and for projected national defense needs.""

Trump defended the new duties as essential to national security, claiming they will ""reduce or eliminate the threat posed by imports"" and ensure self-sufficiency in strategic industries.

Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said earlier this year that the share of Ukrainian steel in the U.S. market remains small and poses no threat to domestic U.S. producers.

However, tariffs further jeopardize Ukraine's key metallurgical exports, particularly ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih and Interpipe, which are already suffering due to the war.

Ukraine's metallurgical products make up 57.9% of Ukraine's exports to the U.S., or in dollar amounts, $503 million out of $869 million, according to Svyrydenko. It is unclear what time frame those figures represent.

The U.K. is the only exception to the new tariffs, which will remain at the 25% level for British imports, according to Bloomberg.

Trump defended the tariffs as a way to simplify duties on metals and hinted at retaliatory measures against countries imposing tariffs on American goods.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194989577.jpg

Ukraine's drone assault on Russia's strategic bomber fleet, known as Operation Spiderweb, could escalate the war and provoke unpredictable responses from Moscow, U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg said in an interview with Fox News on June 3.

The operation, launched by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), reportedly targeted four airfields deep inside Russian territory, striking 41 aircraft and inflicting what Kyiv claims is $7 billion in damage.

The targeted air bases reportedly housed Tu-95 and Tu-22M3 bombers, essential carriers of long-range cruise missiles used in Moscow's air strikes on Ukrainian cities.

""I'm telling you the risk levels are going way up,"" Kellogg said. ""When you attack an opponent's part of their national survival system, which is their nuclear triad, that means your risk level goes up because you don't know what the other side's going to do.""

According to the SBU, 117 drones were launched from mobile platforms across Russia, enabling simultaneous strikes on targets located thousands of kilometers from Ukraine's borders.

Kellogg also pointed to reports of explosions at the Severomorsk naval base, home to some of Russia's most advanced submarines. Kyiv has not confirmed targeting Russia's Northern Fleet.

""The one that really concerned me was the fact that there have been reports that they attacked the naval, the Northern Fleet headquarters in Severomorsk,"" Kellogg said. ""And if that's the case — when you attack two legs of a triad — it's very clear the risk levels will go up.""

Russian officials have denied that the base was hit, and no independent confirmation has emerged.

According to Kellogg, the attacks showed that Kyiv ""is not lying down on that.""

""Ukraine is basically, 'We can play this game, too.' And they can raise the risk level to levels that are basically, to me, they've got to be unacceptable,"" he added.

Despite the scale and strategic implications of the Ukrainian operation, Russian President Vladimir Putin has not publicly addressed the strike. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has positioned himself as a would-be peacemaker, has also remained silent.

Pressed by reporters on June 3, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Trump was not informed in advance about the operation.

""I would like to let the president speak on that himself,"" Leavitt said. She later added, ""The president does not want to see this war prolonged. He wants this war to stop.""

Ukrainian officials say the operation took 18 months to plan. While Kyiv says the strike dealt a serious blow to Russia's strategic air capabilities, the full extent of the damage remains unverified.

Ukraine was jubilant on June 1 as news filtered through of a stunning drone attack targeting Russian heavy bombers, that simultaneously targeted four air bases, two of them thousands of miles inside Russia.

""Enemy strategic bombers are burning en masse in Russia — this is the result of a special operation by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU),"" a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent on June 1.

As well as the physical damage inflicted upon Russia by the attack, retired Australian Army Major-General Mick Ryan, told the Kyiv Independent it was also a ""psychological blow.""

""That's the really profound impact for the Russians, that they're still vulnerable after three and a half years of war, that Ukraine can reach out and hurt them anywhere in Russia, including in the far east,"" he added.

Here's everything we know — and don't know — about Operation Spiderweb.

Ukraine's Russian bomber problem

Throughout Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, its extensive fleet of heavy bombers have regularly launched mass missile attacks against Ukrainian cities, in particular targeting energy infrastructure in attacks that led to long periods of widespread blackouts across the country, and caused countless civilian deaths and injuries.

During these attacks, the bombers fly from their bases to the Caspian Sea from where they launch their cruise missile payloads, before returning to their bases.

Throughout their sorties they fly in perfect safety, far out of range of Ukraine's air defenses.

Their bases are also far from Ukraine, and out of range of any missiles that Ukraine possesses or has been given by its Western allies.

Some air bases are in range of Ukraine's long-range drones, but as these are less sophisticated than missiles and carry smaller warheads, Kyiv has until now only had limited success in using them against Russia's heavy bombers.

While Ukraine is taking steps to develop its own cruise and ballistic missiles that could reach these bases, as well as improving the reach and firepower of its long-range drones, Operation Spiderweb used one of the cheapest weapons already used on the battlefield — first-person-view (FPV) drones.

What do we know about the Operation Spiderweb drone operation?

The first thing anyone knew about the attack were videos posted to social media by bemused Russians showing the bizarre scene of FPV drones flying out of the back of a truck and heading towards an already flaming air base.

Russian media describe the logistics of the Ukrainian operation:



Investigators questioned the truck drivers whose vehicles were used to launch drones

The SBU quickly began releasing information about the operation, even as it was reportedly still underway, and the extent of what was unfolding quickly became clear.

A year-and-a-half in the planning, and reportedly personally overseen by SBU Chief Vasyl Malyuk and President Volodymyr Zelensky, Operation Spiderweb was, in Zelensky's words, an ""absolutely unique operation.""

According to the SBU, the drones were smuggled into Russia where they were then hidden in the roofs of wooden cabins, which were then transported by truck to the air bases being targeted.

When they reached their destinations, the roofs were retracted remotely and the drones simply flew off towards the Russian bombers.

Zelensky later on June 1 released further information about the operation, including elements that are brazen in their audacity.

""What’s most interesting, and this can now be stated publicly, is that the 'office' of our operation on Russian territory was located directly next to FSB headquarters in one of their regions,"" he said.

Zelensky also said that 117 drones were deployed with the ""corresponding number of drone operators.""

​​""It’s genuinely satisfying when something I authorized a year and six months ago comes to fruition and deprives Russians of over forty units of strategic aviation,"" he added.

That satisfaction was also being felt on the streets of the Ukrainian capital on June 2. ""I was actually shocked and couldn’t believe they had pulled this off. In my opinion, it’s some kind of fantastic operation,” Volodymyr, a Kyiv resident, told the Kyiv Independent.

What don't we know about the operation?

The full extent of the damage caused is not yet clear.

The SBU claimed more than 40 aircraft were hit at four different air bases — Belaya air base in Irkutsk Oblast, Olenya air base in Murmansk Oblast, Diaghilev airbase in Ryazan Oblast, and Ivanovo airbase in Ivanovo Oblast.

It added that the aircraft hit included A-50s, Tu-95s and Tu-22 M3s, and released one video clearly showing several aircraft ablaze at the Belaya air base.

The SBU later claimed the operation caused approximately $7 billion in damage and disabled one third of Russia's cruise missile bombers.

On June 3, Ukraine's General Staff said 41 Russian military aircraft were hit during Operation Spiderweb.

At least two A-50 Russian surveillance aircraft were damaged, the Telegraph reported on June 3, citing footage viewed by the publication.

""This was not just a devastating blow to enemy aviation, but a serious slap in the face of the power and terrorist essence of the Russian Federation,"" Malyuk said in a statement on June 2.

Independent confirmation of the damage caused is so far limited to satellite images of Belaya air base, which appear to confirm the destruction of at least three Tu-95MS strategic bombers and one Tu-22M3 aircraft, with an additional Tu-95MS visibly damaged.

Another image shows two more likely destroyed Tu-22M3 bombers on the field.

What a remarkable success in a well-executed… pic.twitter.com/LzXulw8jnK — Chris Biggers (@CSBiggers) June 2, 2025

The damage appears to have been limited to the Olenya and Belaya airbases, with the Russian Defense Ministry claiming to have thwarted the attacks at the Diaghilev and Ivanovo airbases.

How many bombers does Russia have?

According to the World Directory of Modern Military Aircraft, an organisation that tracks and ranks the world's air forces, Russia at the beginning of 2025 had 58 Tu-22Ms, 47 Tu-95s, and 15 Tu-160 bombers.

With 120 heavy bombers in total, Ukraine's claim of disabling one third is in line with its claim of hitting around 40 of them.

But perhaps the biggest prize for Ukraine is the A-50 airborne early warning aircraft which provides several critical functions for the ongoing war in Ukraine, such as detecting air defense systems, guided missiles, and coordinating targets for Russian fighter jets.

It's believed that Russia has fewer than 10 of these in operation, and Ukraine's military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov claimed in February 2024 that the number was as few as six shortly after Ukraine managed to shoot one down for the first time.

Ukraine downed another A-50 four months later, in June 2024.

What else do we not know about Operation Spiderweb?

Despite the global reaction to the attack, some of those who have been following the rapid advances of drone technology during Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine saw such an operation coming.

""I wasn't really that surprised,"" Samuel Bendett, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank, told the Kyiv Independent.

Bendett highlighted that Russian milbloggers have long been urging the Kremlin to up security at air bases in the event of such an attack, something that appears to have gone unheeded.

A picture of SBU Chief Vasyl Malyuk planning operation ""Web,"" date and location not disclosed (Ukraine's Security Service)

He also said that although the attack was ""audacious,"" the means and technology to conduct an operation like this aren't that new

Ryan echoed the sentiment, saying it was ""audacious and important, but I don't think it's going to see any kind of turning point in the war.""

""It's certainly a useful case study of the creative application of autonomous systems,"" he said, adding: ""But I don't think this by itself has upended the rules of warfare or anything like that.""

One thing that isn't clear at the moment is how the drones were controlled — Zelensky said each drone had an individual operator but FPV drones are usually limited in range to a maximum of around 20 kilometers.

Bendett said the drones were most likely pre-programmed to fly out of the trucks and towards the air base with the operators taking over using Russian mobile networks when they were over the planes ""to ensure the most precise strike.""

Another thing that's not clear at the moment is how the trucks got to the airbases.

Zelensky on June 1 said all those who assisted in the attack ""were withdrawn from Russian territory before the operation, they are now safe.""

Taking this at face value, it would imply the drivers of the truck were unwitting stooges.

Russian media channel Baza, citing Russian investigators, claimed all four trucks belonged to the same person who was asked to make deliveries of the wooden cabins by an unknown person(s). All four drivers later reportedly received instructions on exactly where to stop the trucks, at cafes and gas stations located near the air bases that were targeted.

This information remains unconfirmed at this time.

What has Russia said?

Very little. On June 1, Russia's Defense Ministry acknowledged what it described as a ""terrorist attack"" on the four air bases and said ""several units of aircraft caught fire"" at Murmansk and Irkutsk.

The Kremlin has so far kept quiet.

But Russian milbloggers have been much more vocal, describing it as a ""black day for aviation.""

Rybar, one of the most popular with millions of subscribers on Telegram, said ""serious errors by Russian intelligence had allowed Ukraine to strike a ""very heavy blow.

Russian opposition columnist Yulia Latynina even described the attack as ""Russia's Pearl Harbor.""

An operation by Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) using first-person-view (FPV) drones smuggled deep inside Russian and hidden inside trucks has hit 41 Russian heavy bombers at four airfields across the country, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent on June 1.

The operation — codenamed ""Spiderweb"" and a year-and-a-half in the planning — appears to have dealt a major blow to the aircraft Moscow uses to launch long-range missile attacks on Ukraine's cities.

""The SBU first transported FPV drones to Russia, and later, on the territory of the Russian Federation, the drones were hidden under the roofs of mobile wooden cabins, already placed on trucks,"" the source said.

""At the right moment, the roofs of the cabins were opened remotely, and the drones flew to hit Russian bombers.""

The source said one of the airfields hit was the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk Oblast, more than 4,000 kilometers from Ukraine.

Olenya air base in Russia's Murmansk Oblast, the Diaghilev airbase in Ryazan Oblast, Ivanovo airbase in Ivanovo Oblast were also targeted.

""Currently, more than 40 aircraft are known to have been hit, including the A-50, Tu-95 and Tu-22 M3,"" the source added.

The SBU later reported that the drone operation caused approximately $7 billion in damages and disabled 34% of cruise missile carriers in key Russian airbases.

The agency said that more details will be revealed soon. Also, they vowed to continue to drive Russian forces out of Ukrainian territory.

“We will strike them (Russia) at sea, in the air, and on the ground. And if needed, we’ll get them from underground too,” the SBU said.

A video provided by the source shows what appears to be a row of heavy bomber aircraft on fire at one of the airbases.

Ukraine has long-struggled to target the Russian bombers used to launch mass missile targets against Ukrainian cities, as Moscow has kept them out of range of weapons Kyiv has developed itself as well as those supplied by its Western allies.

The use of FPV drones in such a way would mark just the latest stage in the ever-evolving and still relatively fledgling world on drone warfare.

The attack was also likely highly cost effective — FPV drones can be bought for a just a few hundred dollars each but the cost of 41 heavy bombers runs into the billions.

The source said that those behind the operation have ""been in Ukraine for a long time.""

""So, if the Putin regime demonstratively detains someone, it will be another staged performance for the domestic audience,"" they said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky and SBU Chief Vasyl Malyuk personally oversaw the operation, they added.

On the evening of June 1, Zelensky described the operation as ""brilliant,"" adding that Russia suffered ""significant losses — entirely justified and deserved.""

""What’s most interesting, and this can now be stated publicly, is that the 'office' of our operation on Russian territory was located directly next to FSB headquarters in one of their regions,"" he said in a post on social media.

""In total, 117 drones were used in the operation with a corresponding number of drone operators involved,"" he added.

Maliuk publicly confirmed on June 2 the details of the attack, including successful hits against 41 planes parked at the four aforementioned air bases. The SBU chief stressed that ""our strikes will last exactly as long as Russia keeps terrorizing Ukrainians with missiles and Shahed drones.""

Russia ""thought that it could bomb Ukraine and endlessly kill Ukrainians with impunity. But that is not the case. We will respond to Russian terror and destroy the enemy everywhere - at sea, in the air, and on land,"" Maliuk added.

In March, Ukraine announced it had developed a new drone with a range of 3,000 kilometers but gave no details about its type, its name, the size of its warhead, or when it would go into mass production.

But even this long-range drone would not be capable of reaching some of the air bases hit in the operation.

The Russian aircraft allegedly hit

The A-50 provides several critical functions for the ongoing war in Ukraine, such as detecting air defense systems, guided missiles, and coordinating targets for Russian fighter jets.

Russia possesses fewer than ten of these planes. A-50 aircraft have an estimated price tag of around $350 million.

The Tupolev Tu-95, the Tupolev Tu-22, as well as the Tupolev Tu-160, are all Russian heavy bombers regularly used to launch missiles at Ukrainian cities.

The Tu-95 is the oldest of the three aircraft, a Soviet-era plane that made its first flight in 1952. It was originally used to carry nuclear bombs but has since evolved to launch cruise missiles.

Each aircraft can carry 16 cruise missiles – either the Kh-55/Kh-555 or the newer Kh-101 and Kh-102 air-launched cruise missiles.

A picture of SBU Chief Vasyl Malyuk planning operation ""Web,"" date and location not disclosed (Ukraine's Security Service)

It features turboprop engines rather than jet engines, as during the Cold War, their increased efficiency allowed it to fly all the way to the United States without refueling.

The Tu-22 carries the Kh-22 missiles, which pose a particular problem for Ukraine. It is supersonic and travels at around 4,000 kilometers per hour.

Currently, it can only be shot down with the U.S.-made Patriot air defense system and potentially the SAMP-T, a joint Italian-French system.

The Tu-160 is Russia's more modern strategic bomber, entering service in 1987. To this day, it remains the largest operational bomber in the world.

It can carry a total of 12 Kh-55 missiles and up to 24 Kh-15s.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has been informed about Ukraine's recent drone attack against Russian air bases, and the ""incident"" is being investigated, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on June 3, according to the state-run news agency TASS.

The operation, conducted by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on June 1, reportedly hit 41 bomber planes and other aircraft, inflicting what Kyiv claims is $7 billion in damage and disabling over a third of Russia's strategic bomber fleet.

Peskov's comments marked the first reaction by the Kremlin to the attack. Despite the operation's scale, Putin has not commented on it publicly.

""The president received information about the incident online,"" Peskov said.

""An investigation has been launched by the Investigative Committee. There was also a corresponding statement from the Defense Ministry.""

The Kremlin's muted response contrasts sharply with jubilant reactions in Ukraine, where officials described the coordinated drone strikes as a major success.

The SBU said 117 drones, launched from concealed trucks positioned across Russian territory, simultaneously struck airfields in at least four regions — including sites thousands of kilometers from the Ukrainian border.

The targeted air bases reportedly housed Tu-95 and Tu-22M3 bombers, key carriers of long-range cruise missiles used in Moscow's air strikes on Ukrainian cities.

The operation reportedly took 18 months of planning and was timed just days after Russia launched a wave of mass aerial assaults on Ukraine, including the record-setting attack on June 2 that killed and injured civilians.

While the Kremlin remains restrained, some Russian pro-war commentators and propagandists have responded with fury.

Some downplayed the attack's scale, while others called for nuclear retaliation or strikes on NATO airfields in response to what they described as Western complicity.

Ukraine has declined to pay holders of $2.6 billion in warrants linked to the country's GDP, defaulting on its sovereign debt payment, the Wall Street Journal reported on June 3.

The country's Finance Ministry announced last week it would skip a $665 million government debt payment after failing to agree on restructuring terms with creditors.

Ukraine said in April it had failed to reach an agreement to restructure a debt consisting of so-called GDP warrants, a financial instrument that gives the debtholder the right to additional payments based on economic performance.

""Ukraine remains committed to implementing a comprehensive, fair and equitable restructuring of the GDP-linked securities,"" the Finance Ministry told Bloomberg last week, saying that the non-payment is linked to a broader restructuring of the country's obligations.

Ukraine's economy has struggled in the face of Russia's war. Its GDP fell drastically in the early days of Russia's full-scale invasion and has steadily grown since.

The European Bank for Development and Reconstruction (EBRD) forecasts Ukraine's GDP will grow 3.3% in 2025, down from an initial forecast expecting growth of 3.5%.

""The GDP warrants were designed for a world that no longer exists. Ukraine's modest economic growth in 2023 was not a sign of surging prosperity but a fragile rebound from a nearly 30% downturn caused by Russia’s full-scale invasion,"" Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko said in April.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that failure to resolve the GDP warrant issue could threaten further debt restructuring, as well as an ongoing $15.6 billion bailout program, the Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Ukraine has said it will seek to abide by its agreements with the IMF.

Kyiv reached an agreement with some of its creditors in July 2024 to restructure more than $20 billion in international bonds, allowing Ukraine to avoid default amid Russia's full-scale war.

At least two A-50 Russian surveillance aircraft were damaged in Ukraine's June 1 drone strike inside Russia, the Telegraph reported on June 3, citing footage viewed by the publication.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) executed Operation Spiderweb on June 1, targeting four key air bases and destroying around 40 heavy bombers by smuggling trucks of first-person-view (FPV) drones deep inside Russia.

Footage shared with the Telegraph reportedly shows Ukrainian drones hitting two A-50s, rare Russian spy planes that Moscow relies on for several critical functions in its full-scale war against Ukraine.

Drones struck the radar domes of two A-50 aircraft, according to the Telegraph. One plane appeared to be protected by sandbags along its wings, while the other had tires arranged across its airframe.

Open source satellite images from May 2 appear show two A-50s stationed at the Ivanovo air base in Russia's Ivanovo Oblast, one of the airfields targeted in Operation Spiderweb. The footage shared with the Telegraph makes it clear that these are the same A-50s damaged in the June 1 attack.

The video also reportedly shows several Tupolev bombers in flames after sustaining direct hits from Ukrainian drones.

An SBU source told the Kyiv Independent on June 1 that A-50s were among the aircraft hit in the attack, but the claim could not be verified at the time.

Russia's A-50s detect air defense systems, guide missiles, and coordinate targets for Russian fighter jets. The aircraft carry an estimated price tag of around $350 million.

They are also extremely rare: Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR), said in February 2024 that Moscow only had six A-50s in its arsenal.

Ukraine previously shot down two A-50s in January and February 2024.

Kyiv's audacious drone strike deep within Russia took 18 months of planning and dealt a major blow to Russia's fleet of bombers — only days after Moscow launched a series of record-breaking mass aerial attacks against Ukraine.

The SBU reported that the operation caused approximately $7 billion in damages and disabled 34% of cruise missile carriers in key Russian airbases.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/A50-rus-aircraft.jpeg

The United Kingdom pledged on June 4 to supply Ukraine with 100,000 drones by the end of the financial year in April 2026, after saying that unmanned aerial vehicles have changed the way modern wars are fought.

The drone package – valued at £350 million ($473 million) – is part of a broader £4.5 billion military support initiative for Ukraine and marks a tenfold increase from a target of 10,000 in 2024 to 100,000 in 2025, the U.K. government said.

""The UK is stepping up its support for Ukraine by delivering hundreds of thousands more drones this year and completing a major milestone in the delivery of critical artillery ammunition,"" Defense Secretary John Healey said in a statement.

The increase in drone support is timely, as it follows Ukraine's successful Operation Spiderweb on June 1. As part of the operation, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) smuggled 117 drones into Russian territory, striking four airbases and damaging 41 military aircraft.

In addition to drone deliveries, the U.K. government confirmed the delivery of 140,000 artillery shells to Ukraine since January and will spend an additional £247 million ($334 million) this year to train Ukrainian troops.

""We are learning lessons every day from the battlefield in Ukraine, which British companies are using to develop advanced new drones to help protect Ukraine’s civilians and also strengthen our own national security,"" Healey said.

On June 2, the U.K. government endorsed an independent Strategic Defense Review that called for a more technologically advanced military to counter emerging threats, including potential Russian aggression. Citing the war in Ukraine, the review emphasized the importance of drones and digital warfare.

To that end, the U.K. will devote more than £4 billion ($5.4 billion) to the development of autonomous systems and drones for the UK Armed Forces to help learn the lessons from Ukraine.

This follows a recent commitment from the government to increase military spending to 2.5% of total gross domestic product (GDP) by April 2027.

Later today, the U.K. and Germany will co-host the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting in Brussels, where the group will coordinate further military aid to Ukraine.

A Trump official who dismantled a counter-disinformation office in the United States government has links to the Kremlin, the Telegraph reported on June 3.

Darren Beattie, who was appointed to the State Department in February 2025 as under secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs, has come under scrutiny for his pro-Russian views. According to the Telegraph, Beattie is married to a Russian woman with links to the Kremlin.

His wife – Yulia Kirillova – is the niece of Sergei Chernikov, a former Russian official who reportedly helped Russian President Vladimir Putin in the election campaign which first brought him to power in 2000.

Beattie notably played a role in dismantling the Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference office, or R/FIMI, which was previously tasked with tracking and countering disinformation from Russia, China, and Iran.

R/FIMI was officially shut down in April 2025, according to a press statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who claimed that the office ""spent millions of dollars to actively silence and censor the voices of Americans they were supposed to be serving.""

According to sources cited by the Telegraph, Beattie relentlessly pursued R/FIMI after his appointment to the State Department. Secretary Rubio confirmed that Beattie played a significant role in dismantling the agency.

Beattie also showed a keen interest in classified materials related to Russia, raising concerns about granting him access to sensitive information. The sources also expressed concerns about whether he had been adequately vetted – a process that can take anywhere from a couple of months to over a year to complete.

Beattie previously served in the first Trump administration but was ousted after allegedly attending a white nationalist conference in 2018. Since then, he reinvented himself as an ""alt-right media"" figure and founded the news outlet Revolver.

Through Revolver, Beattie has long criticized R/FIMI and promoted narratives aligned with Kremlin disinformation. He has argued that the U.S. orchestrates ""color revolutions"" around the world, including in Ukraine – a common narrative used in Kremlin propaganda to delegitimize pro-democracy movements as Western-backed coups.

Beattie has also written social media posts suggesting that Western institutions should be ""infiltrated"" by the Kremlin, and has attacked the so-called ""globalist American empire.""

Two months before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Beattie wrote on X: ""Imagine the whining from the Globalist American Empire if Putin 'invades' Ukraine... love it when our national security bureaucrats fail!""

The Trump administration has repeatedly come under fire for its perceived sympathies toward Russia. It has also been criticized for shuttering R/FIMI, particularly amidst a global ""information war.""

According to the National Endowment for Democracy, Russia spends an estimated $1.5 billion annually on disinformation and foreign influence campaigns.

Latvia was elected on June 3 to the United Nations Security Council for the first time in its history.

Along with four other countries – Bahrain, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Liberia – Latvia will serve a two-year term, beginning in January 2026, as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.

Reacting to the vote, Latvian Foreign Minister Baiba Braze called it a ""historic day for Latvia.""

""We are honored by the trust placed in us and ready to take on this responsibility to defend the rules-based international order,"" she wrote on X.



With the exception of Latvia – which is taking a seat on the council for the first time – all the elected countries have previously served.

The newly elected countries will take the place of Algeria, Guyana, the Republic of Korea, Sierra Leone, and Slovenia, whose terms will end in December 2025. They will join the five non-permanent members that were elected last year – Denmark, Greece, Pakistan, Panama, and Somalia.

The UN Security Council is the main UN body responsible for maintaining international peace and security. It is composed of 15 members, including five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The permanent members hold veto power.

Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin has repeatedly used its veto power to block resolutions concerning its actions in Ukraine. Latvia, a vocal critic of Russia, has consistently pushed for stronger Western support for Ukraine.

The Baltic nation has been a steadfast ally of Ukraine – it recently delivered 1,500 combat drones to Ukraine and has committed providing military support at the level of 0.25% of its GDP every year.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is urging European member nations to increase their ground-based air defense capacities by five times in order to mount a more effective response to the threat of Russian aggression, Bloomberg reported on June 3, citing sources familiar with the matter.

The reported request is NATO's latest bid to shore up European security amid heightened tensions with Russia and an increasingly uncertain U.S. commitment to Europe's defense.

NATO defense ministers will discuss the air defense boost at a gathering in Brussels on June 5, sources told Bloomberg on the condition of anonymity. A number of proposed defense increases are on the agenda for the meeting, which will set the stage for the NATO summit in The Hague on June 24-25.

The air defense target is a collective goal for NATO's European members, with varying levels from individual states, sources said. The timeframe for the fivefold increase is not yet clear.

According to one senior European military official, NATO members face a shortage of ground-based air-defense systems to protect against drones, missiles, and fighter jets, having shifted away from these systems after the end of the Cold War.

""We are not at war, but we're not at peace either,"" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said during the Vilnius summit of the Bucharest Nine (B9) and the Nordic countries on June 2.

""We must continue to strengthen our deterrence and defense and that means pivoting toward a full war-fighting readiness.""

Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 prompted European countries to hike defense spending in order to revive their military capabilities following decades of disarmament.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban railed against Ukraine's future accession to the European Union in a social media post on June 3, promising to ""do everything"" to prevent Ukraine from joining the bloc.

Under the Orban regime, Hungary has become widely regarded as the most Kremlin-friendly state in the EU. Budapest has been blocking the opening of EU accession negotiation clusters with Kyiv and signaled further obstruction in recent weeks after Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) said it had uncovered a Hungarian spy network in western Ukraine.

In a Facebook post on June 3, Orban called EU expansion ""a noble idea"" but excoriated ""the bureaucrats in Brussels"" for promoting Ukraine's membership.

""For Brussels, Ukrainian accession is a vital issue: political damage control and good business in the midst of a losing war,"" he wrote.

Orban claimed that Kyiv's membership would hurt Hungarian interests and have economic drawbacks for Europe.

""Ukraine would suck up every euro, forint and zloty that we have spent so far on strengthening European families, European farmers, and European industry. ... In 10 years, I would not be able to answer my conscience to myself, my grandchildren, or the country if I did not do everything now to protect Hungary and the European Union from the Brussels fever dream of Ukrainian accession.""

Orban encouraged Hungarians to vote in a non-binding national poll on Ukraine's EU bid that the government launched in early March. The poll has garnered criticism for low turnout and manipulative questions, written to encourage citizens to reject Ukraine's accession.

Kyiv formally applied for EU membership in 2022 and began accession talks in June 2024. EU leaders have set 2030 as a tentative target date for Ukraine's potential entry. As a member state, Hungary holds veto power over each phase of the process.

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said on May 9 that while the EU would prefer to secure unanimous support, it has alternative plans if Hungary vetoes Ukraine's accession to the bloc.

After the scandal regarding the alleged spy ring broke out in early May, Budapest announced it is suspending talks with Ukraine on ""national minority rights,"" long presented by Hungary as the main roadblock in accession negotiations.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/GettyImages-2215514456.jpg

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) carried out the third attack against the Crimean Bridge since Russia's full-scale war began in 2022, mining and damaging its underwater supports, the SBU announced on June 3.

""God loves the Trinity, and the SBU always brings what is conceived to the end and never repeats itself,"" SBU Chief Vasyl Malyuk said in a statement posted on social media.

""Previously, we struck the Crimean Bridge in 2022 and 2023. So today we continued this tradition underwater,"" he added.

The SBU said the operation ""lasted for several months,"" with agents mining the ""supports of this illegal construction.""

Constructed after Russia’s illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014, the Crimean Bridge is a critical supply and transport route for Russian forces to the occupied Ukrainian territories.

""And today, without inflicting any civilian casualties, the first explosive was activated at 4:44 a.m.,"" the SBU said.

Underwater supports of the bridge's piers were severely damaged at the bottom as 1,100 kilograms of explosives in TNT equivalent were detonated, according to the statement.

Russian state media later reported a ""Ukrainian intelligence agent"" who had constructed a bomb on ""orders from Kyiv"" had been detained by Russia's FSB.

In comments later on June 3, Dmytro Pletenchuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Navy, said the ""key and most complex"" part of the bridge had been damaged in the attack.

The operation, which follows the SBU's mass drone strike against Russia's strategic aviation on June 1, was personally supervised by the agency's chief, Vasyl Maliuk.

President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the SBU in his evening address, though he did not refer to the attack directly.

""And it is always nice to give special thanks to the Security Service of Ukraine, well done!"" he said.

A claimed ""agent of Ukrainian intelligence services"" has been detained in Crimea, Russia's Federal Security Service said later on June 3, accusing the detainee of producing a ""powerful explosive.""

The bridge suffered significant damage during two previous Ukrainian attacks in October 2022 and July 2023, though neither managed to take the bridge out of commission.

The construction of the bridge, also known as the Kerch Bridge, holds a significant symbolic value for Russia. The $4 billion project was a political statement designed to affirm the Kremlin's illegal 2014 annexation of Crimea, as the peninsula is not connected by land to Russia.

Russia's Defense Ministry previously claimed that three Ukrainian drones were downed over Crimea overnight on June 3.

The Crimean Bridge was closed for traffic between 6 and 9 a.m. local time on that day, according to local Telegram channels. The Mash Telegram channel reported that a Ukrainian drone was shot down over the bridge, and its debris fell onto the road.

According to pro-Ukrainian Telegram channel Crimean Wind, the bridge had been closed down for inspection, possibly to examine damage.

Later the same day, Crimean Wind reported a new ""powerful explosion"" near Kerch at around 3 p.m., writing that a helicopter is patrolling the strait. Several local channels reported that a fresh drone attack against the peninsula was underway in the afternoon, and that the bridge is closed once again.

U.S. President Donald Trump was not informed in advance about Operation Spiderweb, Ukraine's mass drone strike that damaged over 40 Russian bombers, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed on June 3.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) smuggled first-person-view (FPV) drones deep within Russia to coordinate attacks against four key air bases on June 1. Trump was not briefed ahead of the operation, Axios reported shortly after the operation, citing a Ukrainian security official.

During a White House press briefing, Leavitt was asked whether Trump was informed by Ukraine about Operation Spiderweb in advance of the attack.

""He was not,"" she said.

The press secretary was also asked about Trump's view of the operation, given his uncharacteristic silence on the matter.

""I would like to let the president speak on that himself,"" she said, then updated her answer by adding that Trump wants the war in Ukraine to end.

""The president does not want to see this war prolonged. He wants this war to stop,"" Leavitt said.

Leavitt praised Trump's efforts as a peacemaker, despite Russia's continued refusal to accept a ceasefire and the escalation of mass attacks against Ukraine. She noted the second round of direct Ukraine-Russia talks on June 2 in Istanbul as a sign of progress, calling the meeting ""inconceivable"" and crediting the step to Trump's intervention.

""(President Trump) remains positive about the progress that we're seeing,"" Leavitt said.

When asked whether Trump supports efforts by congressional Republicans to impose harsher sanctions against Russia, Leavitt did not answer directly, saying that lawmakers would take their cues from the president and trust his judgment as commander-in-chief.

""(H)e has smartly kept this as a tool in his toolbox if necessary,"" Leavitt said, referring to additional sanctions.

Leavitt also said that U.S. defense officials are looking into the implications of Operation Spiderweb for U.S. security and are working to ensure American aircraft are protected from the risks of internal drone strikes.

Trump may take ""some executive action"" regarding the matter in the near future, she said.

Operation Spiderweb is not the first time Ukraine has launched a major attack against Russia without first informing their American counterparts.

Following the second round of direct peace talks with Ukraine, the Russian side leaked its proposal on how to end its war — effectively a demand for Ukraine's surrender.

Yet, if the intentions of the Kremlin are no secret — continue the war until a political or military victory — getting information on what people in Russia think of their country's war and the prospects for peace is a more complicated endeavor.

While those based in Russia interviewed by the Kyiv Independent share a desire for peace, they are no supporters of Ukraine and its sovereignty.

Despite speaking on condition of anonymity and with the ability to freely express their views, Russians inside the country spoke along the official Russian lines — accusing Ukraine of stalling the negotiations or even arguing that there will be no peace as long as Ukraine remains an independent country.

These views are in line with polls conducted in Russia, which some believe are untrustworthy.

Around 64% of the respondents in Russia favored peace talks, according to a poll by the independent Russian pollster Levada Center published on June 2.

However, a majority of respondents (73%) believe that Ukraine should make concessions prior to a ceasefire. Only 18% think that Moscow should agree to a ceasefire and then resolve all other issues.

Soviet nostalgia

The Kyiv Independent interviewed people with different backgrounds and views, including those who have a track record of being opposed to Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.

One of them, a 40-year-old photographer, used to attend rallies against Putin.

Yet the photographer's past opposition to Putin did not make her a supporter of Ukraine, nor did it mean she acknowledged her country's faults. In a conversation with the Kyiv Independent, the photographer expressed nostalgia for the Soviet Union and said that she believes there will be no peace until former Soviet republics are reunited under the Kremlin's wing.

""Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus would unite into one country,"" she said. ""And then there would be no more problems. And all the foreign agents would get kicked out.""

She also argued that ""recognizing all the (occupied) territories as part of Russia is a done deal.""

Russia illegally annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014. The Kremlin also announced the illegal annexation of Ukraine's Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts in 2022 despite only partially controlling them.

(Alexander Nemenov / AFP via Getty Images)

According to a document leaked after the second round of talks with Ukraine, Russia is demanding the official recognition of all these annexations.

Additional demands include Ukraine's neutral status, a ban on the country's NATO bid and other possible military alliances, and an official end to Western arms supplies and intelligence sharing with Ukraine.

According to a source in the Ukrainian President's Office, the Russian delegation effectively showed it doesn't want a peace settlement and is simply buying time to prolong the war.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly stated that Kyiv would not recognize any of the occupied territories as Russian.

Blaming Ukraine

Unlike the photographer, a Russian official who previously worked with Putin's aide Vladimir Medinsky, the head of the Russian delegation during the Istanbul talks, was more ambivalent.

He opposed Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 but has grown more skeptical of Kyiv's position since then and accused Ukraine of stalling the negotiations.

The official shared his personal opinion. He is not connected to the actual talks.

He told the Kyiv Independent that ""any negotiations are a good thing.""

""It's a step forward,"" he said. ""It's better than a demonstrative refusal to negotiate. I agree with (U.S. President Donald) Trump that people shouldn't be dying. Enough already.""

He argued, however, that an unconditional ceasefire is currently ""technically and politically impossible"" because it would be to ""Ukraine's advantage.""

He accused Ukraine of disrupting the talks, saying that it had not sent a proper negotiating team to Istanbul. Ukraine has sent a delegation headed by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to Istanbul, while Russia has sent a low-level delegation headed by Medinsky.

The official claimed that Ukraine ""got carried away and deceived itself with their own propaganda"" and ""put too much faith in their (Western) partners,"" the points often mentioned by Russian state TV.

(Salah Malkawi / Getty Images)

Putin did not attend the Istanbul peace talks despite an invitation from Zelensky to meet him face-to-face. Ukrainian and Western observers have argued that Russia is disrupting the peace negotiations.

The official, who used to work with Medinsky in a field unrelated to negotiations, went on to praise him as a manager and negotiator.

A pessimistic forecast

An IT specialist living in Russia offered a third perspective, blaming neither Moscow nor Kyiv for the war.

""My attitude toward political events is similar to how I view developments on financial markets... or even like the weather,"" he told the Kyiv Independent. ""In my worldview, what happens in all these spheres is the result of a sufficiently large number of actors and factors... rather than the result of malice, stupidity, or genius on the part of specific individuals.""

He said he would be calm about any outcome of the peace talks.

The IT professional told the Kyiv Independent, however, that the war had had a negative impact on his life from a practical standpoint: salaries in the IT sector have dropped, there are fewer job opportunities, and there are major difficulties with accepting payments from abroad.

He also said that financially he can afford not to work but has to have a permanent job to defer potential mobilization.

""But in my view, neither peace nor a ceasefire in Ukraine would actually resolve any of the above problems,"" he said. ""Once this episode of the confrontation ends, another one will just begin.""

He added that ""the key indicator of readiness to end the confrontation is the willingness of all parties to agree on the legal status of the disputed territories.""

""We're nowhere near that,"" he continued.

Russians outside Russia: 'No peace until Putin is out'

In contrast with those based in Russia, Russian political exiles living abroad put the blame squarely on Putin, although they did not blame the Russian people in general for continuing to wage it.

""(Putin is) continuing the war while dragging out these endless negotiations — talks about talks, meetings for the sake of more meetings — hiding everything behind vague, meaningless language, all while keeping the war going,"" Russian opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza told the Kyiv Independent.

Kara-Murza survived poisoning attempts by Russia's Federal Security Service in 2015 and 2021, according to Bellingcat, Der Spiegel, and The Insider.

He was jailed in Russia in 2023 for criticizing Russia's invasion of Ukraine and released and sent abroad in 2024 as part of a prisoner exchange with the West.

Kara-Murza also said that ""Putin is playing Trump brilliantly — because if you just listen to the tone of Trump's statement, it was filled with admiration and enthusiasm after a conversation that, once again, was absolutely meaningless in substance.""

(Heikki Saukkomaa / Lehtikuva / AFP via Getty Images)

He was referring to Trump's statement after a phone call with Putin on May 19, during which the Russian president again rejected an unconditional ceasefire. Trump said the call ""went very well"" and once again refused to impose sanctions against Russia.

Kara-Murza argued that Trump and Putin get along because ""they have the same kind of authoritarian mindset, they share the same psychological profile.""

""I think Trump really wanted to rule the way Putin does — without checks and balances, without a parliament, without opposition, without an independent press,"" he added. ""Even people who were present at their meetings during his first term have said that Trump, in Putin's presence, was like a rabbit staring at a boa constrictor. So I think Trump genuinely admires Putin — personally and sincerely — and wants to be like him.""

Kara-Murza is skeptical about the prospects for peace under Putin.

""I'm convinced that no lasting, long-term — let alone just — peace can exist or will exist as long as Putin's regime remains in power,"" Kara-Murza said.

He said that ""the only real way to stop this war is a democratic Russia.""

""Only when Russia has a normal, legitimate, freely elected government that respects its own laws and the rights of its own citizens will it begin to respect civilized norms of international behavior and return to its internationally recognized borders,"" Kara-Murza added.

In contrast with Kara-Murza, Russians inside the country who spoke on condition of anonymity were more ambivalent about Putin's role, often blaming Ukraine or both sides.

At the same time, Kara-Murza does not extend the blame for the war to Russia as a whole. In 2024, he criticized the sanctions imposed against Russia, saying that only individual sanctions against Putin's inner circle were appropriate.

Ukraine's victory is 'the only real peace'

Another Russian opposition figure, former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov, is on the far end of the spectrum — he is one of the few Russians who unequivocally support sanctions against Russia and call for Ukraine's victory.

He told the Kyiv Independent that ""Putin wants to use negotiations to buy time, to normalize his status as a legitimate leader instead of an invading war criminal, and to distract and sideline Ukraine's allies from taking stronger action against Russia.""

""Putin's impossible demands have not changed,"" he added. ""He's not offering any concessions, and Trump isn't asking Russia to make any. Despite Putin ignoring European and American deadlines for a ceasefire, the only pressure Trump applies is against Ukraine.""

Kasparov also said that ""until there is real pressure via military aid to Ukraine and crippling sanctions on Russia… Putin will have no interest in ending the war.""

""As I have said from the start, the only real peace is Ukrainian victory,"" he added.

Kasparov said that Trump ""is working together with Putin to pressure Ukraine into surrendering so he can claim to be a peacemaker.""

""Trump gave a deadline (for a ceasefire), Putin ignored it,"" he added. ""In their phone call, Putin spouted a bunch of garbage about plans and frameworks, and Trump just said it was all fine.""

Putin' is playing for time'

Arkady Moshes, a Russian-born researcher at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, argued that ""there is nothing to talk about"" as far as Russian-Ukrainian talks are concerned.

""(Russia) is playing for time,"" he said. ""They only agreed to imitate their participation in the negotiations because America wanted it. They want to give Trump a chance to say to his audience that he has already brokered something.""

He also said that Putin ""is interested in continuing the warfare.""

""He's still driven by the thinking that Russia has material advantages over Ukraine,"" Moshes added. ""So Putin still plays for victory and not a draw.""

He said Russia's maximalist demands and unwillingness to compromise show that it is not interested in peace.

""This is the plan, that you come to the talks, put forward maximalist demands, and then blame the other side for not agreeing,"" Moshes added.

After deadly Russian missile and drone attacks in May, Trump expressed strong disapproval of the latest escalation.

""I'm not happy with Putin,"" he told reporters on May 25, adding on Truth Social that the Russian president has gone ""absolutely"" crazy.

So Trump ""faced the wall"" and ""had to make choices"" — either to impose sanctions on Russia or not, Moshes said.

But instead of actually imposing sanctions, Trump just threatened to do so without taking any action, he added.

""Putin is not afraid of these kinds of threats,"" Moshes said. ""He would be afraid of sanctions, but not of threat of sanctions.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2210440099.jpg

While Romania debated its future in its recent presidential election, Romanians in Ukraine’s Chernivtsi Oblast just across the border continued to wrestle with war, mobilization, and the loss of their pre-war lives.

Romania’s tight election race at the end of May kept many in Europe on the edge of their seats as candidates with starkly different visions for the country’s future vied to take office in the EU member state.

Pro-European liberal Nicusor Dan, who supported aid to Ukraine in fighting off Russia’s invasion, defeated his opponent George Simion, a far-right Eurosceptic candidate who opposed supporting Ukraine and was banned from entering the country over his ""systematic anti-Ukrainian activities.""

In the west, Ukraine’s historically diverse population includes sizable communities of ethnic Romanians, Poles, and Hungarians. Their ancestors lived with Ukrainians in the areas that became Ukrainian after the borders took their current shape in the First and Second World Wars.

”My grandma is a Romanian, my grandpa is a Romanian, father is a Romanian. I am (also) a Romanian,” said Oleksandr, 58, a resident of Ukraine and one of only 431 people who cast votes for a Romanian election in Ukraine, according to the turnout numbers provided by the Romanian Special Telecommunications Service. He declined to provide his last name.

""We were good neighbors to each other and have to remain good neighbors.""

Chernivtsi Oblast remains the main hub of ethnic Romanians among the three Ukrainian oblasts bordering Romania. It hosts an estimated more than 100,000 ethnic Romanians, some of whom live in almost entirely Romanian villages, study in Romanian-speaking schools, and organize cultural festivals.

Before the war, many Ukrainians with Romanian roots from the area routinely went to Romania for work or studies, strengthening cultural diplomacy between the countries and fueling the local economy.

“We were good neighbors to each other and have to remain good neighbors (with Romania),” said Ihor, a silver-haired local man who came to the Romanian voting station in Chernivtsi on May 18 with his wife. Ihor did not want to give his last name.

But now in Chernivtsi, far away from most of the Russian attacks on the front and major cities, the war has unsettled the balance that once let the Romanian community move easily between both countries — and cultures.

Military-aged men are not allowed to leave the country and can no longer work abroad. Despite many holding dual Romanian-Ukrainian citizenship, Ukrainian law only recognizes them as Ukrainian citizens. With the oblast’s economy weakened by the loss of income from abroad, local job opportunities are limited. Many men fear being drafted from the streets. Funerals of Ukrainian fighters in Chernivtsi Oblast took place almost daily in May.

A wave of patriotic fervor, which mobilized Ukrainians in response to Russia’s invasion, has bolstered the Ukrainian language's role as the state language. But in Chernivtsi, the ethnic Romanian minority hopes that their opportunities to live, study, and pray in the Romanian language in Ukraine won’t be affected by Ukraine’s pushback against centuries of Russification.

Getting a Romanian passport to work abroad

Residents and Romanian activists say the majority of dual citizens in Chernivtsi Oblast obtained Romanian citizenship for economic, not identity-based reasons. Romanian law grants the right to citizenship to any Ukrainian who can prove their descent from people who lived in Chernivtsi Oblast during Romanian rule from the late 1910s to the 1940s.

“Mainly, (people got dual citizenship) to have access to European countries.”

“In our Ukraine, there is no job, and nothing to live on,” said ethnic Romanian Vasyl Bota, 74, whose five children left to work abroad before the full-scale invasion.

“Mainly, (people got dual citizenship) to have access to European countries,” said Vasyl Byku, an ethnic Romanian activist and the head of the Romanian Culture Society named after Mihai Eminescu, a Romanian romantic poet and novelist.

“The situation was different before, there was a visa regime (with the European Union),” Byku told the Kyiv Independent. “Visas were very expensive. People went to Europe, were caught there, returned, and deported. (With a Romanian passport), they got an opportunity to go and do some work.”

People from Chernivtsi and other western oblasts would direct their earnings from abroad to renovating their family houses in Ukraine, said Lavrentii, a driver with dual Ukrainian-Romanian citizenship who often transports people across the Romanian border.

“It also gave work in construction to people living here. The chain has been interrupted. It affects everything,” Lavrentii added.

Mobilization

Locals say it’s widely known in Chernivtsi that a routine document check done by draft office patrols can result in being drafted right off the streets.

In Chernivtsi, Oleksii Rusetskyi was drafted on New Year’s Eve at the train station as he was arriving from Kyiv, his sister, Olena Mishakova, told the Kyiv Independent on May 18 at a rally in the city’s downtown area for missing and captured soldiers.

Mishakova held up a large Ukrainian flag with her brother’s picture, along with another hundred silent women, children, and men lined up with flags and pictures of their family members.

“We were born here as Romanians, but this does not mean that we are not citizens of Ukraine. We are citizens of Ukraine in the first place.”

Her brother went missing in Donetsk Oblast on Dec. 25, a year into his service.

The fear of being drafted has also changed daily life for men in Chernivtsi. Ivan, a taxi driver who declined to give his last name, regularly checked a chat on Viber with over 33,000 members where people shared updates on the draft office patrols around the city. He told the Kyiv Independent that he avoided trips outside Chernivtsi, afraid he could be conscripted at any one of the checkpoints encircling it.

“All the young people took their families and left to Romania, to Europe, because they don't see a future here,” said Yurii Levchyk, a Chernivtsi district council member and the director of the Bukovyna art center for revival and promotion of Romanian culture.

“For one, this is no longer a state here, it's a police system,” Levchyk told the Kyiv Independent as he walked from the voting station to his art center on May 18.

“People are being grabbed on the streets. There are still plenty of (ethnic Romanian) people here, but they are hiding,” he added.

Many ethnic Romanians in Chernivtsi Oblast have also volunteered to fight for their homeland, Ukraine, Byku said.

“In every (ethnic Romanian) village, our national flags for fallen soldiers stand in the cemeteries,” Byku said. “We were born here as Romanians, but this does not mean that we are not citizens of Ukraine. We are citizens of Ukraine first and foremost.”

Romanian minority rights

Simion’s position on the Russian war in Ukraine fueled old tensions between Romania and Ukraine concerning Romanian minority rights.

“Maybe the war deepened all our problems,” Levchyk said, referring to government corruption, the lack of accountability for the authorities, and cases of potentially unlawful mobilization.

“We didn't feel any major problems (before the full-scale war). Sometimes we thought that we were being wronged, but we would bring it up and discuss, and put things right,” Levchyk said, describing his frustration with the problems in the country that were not specific to Romanians.



""The war deepened all the problems.""

Beyond the frustrations many Ukrainians share about the government, Byku said that ethnic Romanians in Ukraine do not experience ethnic conflict or discrimination.

Earlier, Byku opposed a 2017 law that would have switched about a hundred Romanian-speaking schools around the country to studies in the Ukrainian language. But according to Byku, the schools continue to operate in Romanian as the law was “put on hold.""

“We just want to be citizens of Ukraine. But we don't want to lose our identity. This is very important to us,” Byku added.

Despite this, Russian propaganda actively uses narratives of alleged abuses of minority groups in Ukraine to raise anti-Ukrainian sentiments in Romania.

According to Roman Hryshchuk, a Ukrainian Orthodox priest from the ethnic Romanian village of Hlyboke, the rumors about persecution of the faith and Orthodoxy by Ukrainian authorities are spread in Romania by Romanian-speaking priests from Russian-linked churches, which still dominate Chernivtsi Oblast.

As Ukrainian communities and activists vote to switch their own parishes to the Ukrainian church and leave behind the persistent religious domination of Moscow, Hryshchuk said the priests of Russian-linked churches “lie to their parish” that the Ukrainian church will force them to hold services exclusively in Ukrainian.

However, in 2019, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church founded its Romanian vicariate to accommodate Romanian speakers who wish to hold services in the Romanian language.

“This, in fact, caused a wave of anti-Ukrainian outrage in Romania. And Simion built his (presidential candidate’s) work around this wave,” Hryshchuk added.

Colonel Vadym Sukharevskyi has been dismissed from his position as commander of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces (USF), according to a decree signed by President Volodymyr Zelensky on June 3.

Sukharevskyi will be replaced by Major Robert ""Magyar"" Brovdi, commander of the elite drone unit ""Birds of Magyar.""

The Unmanned Systems Forces were established as a separate branch of Ukraine's military in June 2024. The USF works to improve Ukraine's drone operations, creating drone-specific units, ramping up training, increasing drone production, and pushing innovation. The USF has also carried out hundreds of operations deep within Russian territory.

""I am proud to have had the honor of leading the USF during its first and most difficult year of formation,"" Sukharevskyi said in a post commenting on his dismissal.

""This year, although incomplete, has been spent productively. We have formed and immediately put into practice the principles on which this unique force operates. ... At the same time, at this stage, our vision for the further development of the USF differs from that of the leadership. I believe that the honest and professional decision in this situation is to end my term as commander of the USF. I am leaving my position with deep faith in everyone who continues to carry this idea forward.""

Sukharevskyi, previously deputy commander-in-chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces, was named the first commander of the newly-created USF on June 10, 2024. According to military personnel who spoke anonymously to the Ukrainian news outlet Suspilne, Sukharevskyi's relationship with Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi was tense from the beginning of the USF's formation.

Sukharevskyi's appointment was a decision from the president, not Syrskyi, sources said. People close to both Syrskyi and Sukharevskyi also claimed the two men avoided face-to-face interactions.

According to Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, Sukharevskyi has now been appointed deputy commander of Ukraine's Eastern Operational Command, where he is expected to implement reforms and lead modernization efforts.

Regarding the decision to appoint Brovdi as the new USF commander, Umerov said that Brovdi's ""experience with one of the best units should be expanded to the entire command.""

Along with Sukharevskyi's dismissal and replacement, Ukraine's leadership announced a number of military personnel decisions on June 3, including the appointment of Mykhailo Drapatyi as Commander of the Joint Forces.

Editor's note: Cukr journalists contributed to the reporting of this article.

The Ukrainian city of Sumy was once again the target of a devastating Russian missile strike on June 3, with four people killed and 28 others, including three children, injured.

""The body of a man, killed in the attack, lay on the roadway. It was covered with a thermal blanket, weighed down by fire extinguishers and a bottle of water,"" Cukr journalist Artem Korol told the Kyiv Independent.

""The air was thick with the smell of fuel, likely spilled from ruptured tanks. Remnants of the munition protruded from the asphalt, and dozens of small potholes in the road emerged around it,"" Korol added

Russia launched the attack during rush hour. Anna Shpurik, also a journalist at Cukr, spoke to the driver of a yellow number 55 bus that stopped at a red light moments before an explosion.

He described how shell fragments peppered the vehicle but all the passengers survived, the driver escaping with just an injured arm.

Four others were less fortunate, just the latest civilians killed in escalating Russian strikes on the oblast.

Sumy lies in northeastern Ukraine just over 30 kilometers from the Russian border, and has suffered relentless attacks from Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion.

""At about 9 a.m., the Russians launched an insidious attack on the city center. One of the shells hit a busy road, right during the morning rush hour. People were just going about their daily business,"" Oleh Hryhorov, head of Sumy Regional State Administration, said on Facebook.

Russia launched five attacks on Sumy using multiple launch rocket systems, according to local authorities.

The attack set two cars ablaze, destroying them completely. A medical facility and residential buildings, a private house, and non-residential buildings were also damaged.

Sumy Oblast has recently seen renewed hostilities as Russian forces ramp up activity along the northeastern border.

In late May, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia is accumulating 50,000 troops near Sumy Oblast, seeking to create a 10-kilometer buffer zone in the area.

But even with the escalating recent attacks and tensions, the timing and brutality of the attack still shocked those in Sumy.

""No one ever expects this,"" Ihor Klymenko, head of the Prolisok humanitarian center in Sumy Oblast, told the Kyiv Independent.

""It was a fully deliberate attack on civilians.""

""People are a little nervous and in a state of shock because it is the city center during a working day.""

When Klymenko arrived at the scene ""the cars were still running, and there was blood on the asphalt"".

""Leaves had fallen from the explosions, all covered in glass and blood,"" he added.

Later that morning, shops, kiosks, and a pharmacy were already open and operating along the street that was hit. After the blast shattered windows, employees swept up glass and talked on the phone with their relatives, assuring them they were safe, Shpurik said.

The attack came amid ongoing talks of a ceasefire and peace negotiations. A day before, on June 2, Russia and Ukraine held a second round of talks in Istanbul, which focused on a new prisoner exchange, but yet again failed to achieve a breakthrough in peace efforts.

""The Russians launched a savage strike on Sumy — directly targeting the city and its ordinary streets with rocket artillery. It was a fully deliberate attack on civilians,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X.

According to Zelensky, at least one of the projectiles used by Russia in the attack on Sumy failed to detonate, piercing the wall of a nine-story apartment building.

Key developments on June 3:

Russia's Crimean Bridge rocked by explosions, Ukraine's SBU claims responsibility

Russian strike on downtown Sumy kills at least 4, injures 28, authorities say

Ukraine to deploy new units to counter Russian drone attacks, Air Force says

Ukrainian strike on Russian bombers alarmed Kremlin over nuclear carriers vulnerability, Bloomberg reports

Record number of Russians support peace talks, end of war in Ukraine, poll shows

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) carried out the third attack against the Crimean Bridge since Russia's full-scale war began in 2022, mining and damaging its underwater supports, the SBU announced on June 3.

""God loves the Trinity, and the SBU always brings what is conceived to the end and never repeats itself,"" SBU Chief Vasyl Malyuk said in a statement posted on social media.

""Previously, we struck the Crimean Bridge in 2022 and 2023. So today we continued this tradition underwater,"" he added.

The SBU said the operation ""lasted for several months, with agents mining the ""supports of this illegal construction.""

Constructed after Russia's illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014, the Crimean Bridge is a critical supply and transport route for Russian forces to the occupied Ukrainian territories.

""And today, without inflicting any civilian casualties, the first explosive was activated at 4:44 a.m.,"" the SBU said.

Underwater supports of the bridge's piers were severely damaged at the bottom as 1,100 kilograms of explosives in TNT equivalent were detonated, according to the statement.

Russian state media later reported a ""Ukrainian intelligence agent"" who had constructed a bomb on ""orders from Kyiv"" had been detained by Russia's FSB.

In comments later on June 3, Dmytro Pletenchuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Navy, said the ""key and most cpmplex"" part of the bridge had been damaged in the attack.

The operation, which follows the SBU's mass drone strike against Russia's strategic aviation on June 1, was personally supervised by the agency's chief, Vasyl Maliuk.

A claimed ""agent of Ukrainian intelligence services"" has been detained in Crimea, Russia's Federal Security Service said later on June 3, accusing the detainee of producing a ""powerful explosive.""

The bridge suffered significant damage during two previous Ukrainian attacks in October 2022 and July 2023, though neither managed to take the bridge out of commission.

The construction of the bridge, also known as the Kerch Bridge, holds a significant symbolic value for Russia. The $4 billion project was a political statement designed to affirm the Kremlin's illegal 2014 annexation of Crimea, as the peninsula is not connected by land to Russia.

Russia's Defense Ministry previously claimed that three Ukrainian drones were downed over Crimea overnight on June 3.

The Crimean Bridge was closed for traffic between 6 and 9 a.m. local time on that day, according to local Telegram channels. The Mash Telegram channel reported that a Ukrainian drone was shot down over the bridge, and its debris fell onto the road.

According to pro-Ukrainian Telegram channel Crimean Wind, the bridge had been closed down for inspection, possibly to examine damage.

Later the same day, Crimean Wind reported a new ""powerful explosion"" near Kerch at around 3 p.m., writing that a helicopter is patrolling the strait. Several local channels reported that a fresh drone attack against the peninsula was underway in the afternoon, and that the bridge is closed once again.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

Russian strike on downtown Sumy kills at least 4, injures 28, authorities say

Russian forces attacked downtown Sumy in Ukraine's northeast on June 3, killing four people and injuring 28 others, including three children, according to Ukrainian authorities.

According to preliminary reports, Russia launched five attacks on Sumy using multiple launch rocket systems.

""The Russians launched a savage strike on Sumy — directly targeting the city and its ordinary streets with rocket artillery. It was a fully deliberate attack on civilians,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X.

A 17-year-old was among the injured, with authorities describing the condition of many victims as serious.

At nearly 4:30 p.m. local time, the death toll rose to four after a 43-year-old man who was in a serious condition died in the hospital. His seven-year-old daughter was also severely injured in the Russian attack.

The attack reportedly set two cars ablaze, destroying them completely. A medical facility and residential buildings were also damaged.

At 7 p.m. local time, rescuers finished working at the sites of the attacks. Sappers also examined the affected area and removed the remains of explosives, the State Emergency Service reported.

Local authorities declared June 3 and 4 a day of mourning in Sumy.

According to Zelensky, at least one of the projectiles used by Russia in the attack on Sumy failed to detonate, piercing the wall of a nine-story apartment building.

""That alone says everything one needs to know about Russia's so-called 'desire' to end this war,"" he added, calling on the U.S. and Europe to increase pressure on Moscow.

Sumy Oblast, which borders Russia to the north, has been a repeated target of Russian incursions and shelling since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. The region has recently seen renewed hostilities as Russian forces ramp up activity along the northeastern border.

In late May, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia is accumulating 50,000 troops near Sumy Oblast, seeking to create a 10-kilometer buffer zone in the area.

Ukraine to deploy new units to counter Russian drone attacks, Air Force says

New air defense units will be established to counter Russia's drone attacks on Ukraine, Air Force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat said in an interview with Ukrainska Pravda on June 2.

Despite ongoing peace talks, Russia continues to reject calls for an unconditional ceasefire, intensifying drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, killing and injuring civilians.

Overnight on June 1, Russia launched an aerial assault on Ukraine, deploying a record 472 drones.

Ukrainian forces downed 210 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, while 172 more drones were intercepted by electronic warfare or disappeared from radars, according to the Air Force.

""We would have liked to have had better results, but there were still dozens of hits,"" Ihant said.

According to Ihant, Russia employed tactics involving the launch of a large number of weapons at a single target that approached from high altitude. During their meeting on June 2, air force commanders emphasized the urgent need to strengthen drone air defense capabilities, he said.

""We are talking about anti-aircraft drones that help intercept air targets. Crews are being trained in different locations on the territory of our country. New units will be introduced,"" the spokesperson said.

Russia seeks to produce up to 500 drones per day, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in late May.

Meanwhile, Ukraine has more than doubled its long-range drone production in 2024 compared to the previous year — a staggering 22-fold increase since 2022.

By the end of 2024, Ukraine had developed a total of 324 new types of weapons, according to the Ministry of Strategic Industries.

Ukrainian strike on Russian bombers alarmed Kremlin over nuclear carriers vulnerability, Bloomberg reports

A recent Ukrainian drone strike deep inside Russian territory has sparked anger and concern among Kremlin officials over the exposed vulnerability of a nuclear-capable air force far from the front lines, Bloomberg reported on June 2, citing undisclosed sources close to senior Moscow officials.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) carried out the operation ""Spiderweb"" on June 1, targeting Russian air bases at Belaya, Diaghilev, Olenya, and Ivanovo with drones hidden in trucks across Russia.

The strike is claimed to have hit 41 aircraft, including Tu-95 and Tu-22 bombers. These planes belong to Russia's nuclear-capable air fleet and are used to launch cruise missile attacks on Ukraine's cities.

Ukraine's General Staff said in its daily update on June 3 that Russian forces lost 12 aircraft, without elaborating on the types of destroyed planes or whether more had been damaged.

Meanwhile, a source close to the Kremlin told Bloomberg that the number of affected aircraft may be closer to 10. According to the outlet's sources, only a small number of the targeted Russian bombers are required for strikes against Ukraine, meaning the pace of missile and bombing attacks is unlikely to slow.

The SBU claimed the operation caused approximately $7 billion in damage and disabled one-third of Russia's cruise missile bombers.

Independent confirmation of the damage caused is so far limited to satellite images of Belaya air base, which appear to confirm the destruction of at least three Tu-95MS strategic bombers and one Tu-22M3 aircraft, with an additional Tu-95MS visibly damaged.

Another image shows two more likely destroyed Tu-22M3 bombers on the field.

Record number of Russians support peace talks, end of war in Ukraine, poll shows

The number of Russian citizens who support peace talks and an end to the war in Ukraine has reached a record high since the start of the full-scale invasion, according to a poll by the independent Russian pollster Levada Center published on June 2.

Some 64% of the respondents favored peace talks, representing a 6% increase since March. Meanwhile, the number of people who supported the war's continuation decreased from 34% in March to 28% in May.

Compared to previous survey results, in May 2023, 48% of respondents believed that the war should continue. In May 2024, this figure dropped to 43%.

The news comes after the second round of direct peace talks between Ukraine and Russia occurred in Istanbul. The parties agreed on a new prisoner exchange, as well as the repatriation of 6,000 bodies of fallen Ukrainian soldiers. No agreement on a ceasefire was reached.

The share of supporters of peaceful negotiations is higher among women (73%), people under 24 (77%), residents of villages and towns with populations under 100,000 (67% each), as well as those who believe that the country is going in the wrong direction (76%) and those who disapprove of Russian President Vladimir Putin's presidential performance (77%).

The share of those who support continuing the war is higher among men (39%), respondents aged 55 and older (35%), residents of Moscow (40%), those who believe that things in the country are going in the right direction (32%), and those who approve of the activities of the current president (30%).

A majority of respondents (73%) believe that Russia and Ukraine should address the hostilities' root causes and only then agree on a ceasefire. On the contrary, some 18% think that the parties will first reach a truce and ceasefire and then resolve all other issues.

Only 3% of Russians believe Russia is an obstacle to peace. At the same time, 14% of respondents believe that the U.S. is to blame, while 36% each see Ukraine and European countries as major obstacles in peace negotiations.

Mykhailo Drapatyi has been appointed Commander of the Joint Forces after submitting his resignation as Ground Forces Commander, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on June 3.

Drapatyi resigned from his previous role on June 1 following a deadly Russian missile strike that killed at least 12 Ukrainian soldiers at a training camp in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast earlier that day.

He was then summoned to a meeting with Zelensky on June 3.

""I explained to the president the reasons for my decision (to resign). The president heard me, supported me, and suggested that we focus on the main issues — the war, the front line, and victory,"" Drapatyi wrote on Telegram.

The commander also emphasized the need to change the culture of commanders' attitudes toward their soldiers, the performance of their duties, and the value of the life of every Ukrainian soldier.

""I received a task from the president. I am staying in the ranks, on the front line. Where I have to be, where I can do the most,"" Drapatyi said.

During his evening address, Zelensky said that Drapatyi would be appointed Commander of the Joint Forces and focus ""exclusively on combat issues.""

The Russian strike in question hit the 239th Polygon, a Ground Forces training ground north of the city of Dnipro, on June 1. Drapatyi, confirming the location and when announcing his resignation, said the victims were mostly young recruits who ""should have learned, lived, and fought — not died.""

The attack killed 12 people and injured more than 60 others, according to the Ground Forces press office.

The Ground Forces said that if the investigation finds negligence or misconduct contributed to the casualties, those responsible will face strict accountability.

Russian missile attacks on Ukrainian training sites have intensified in recent months. The 239th Polygon was also struck by an Iskander missile in March.

Russia had previously attacked Ukrainian training grounds several times when Ukrainian soldiers were lining up to be awarded for their service.

The attacks, which resulted in heavy casualties, provoked criticism of the top military leadership, which allowed negligence at military facilities.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/q132bb595v3e1.jpeg

In everyday life, these people might appear normal: they have no physical wounds, their loved ones and children are alive by their side.

But Ukrainian photographer Sergey Melnitchenko’s black-and-white portraits reveal the chilling depths that stand between his subjects and normalcy. They gaze outward with calm, matter-of-fact expressions, while the massive superimposed projection of their most haunting war memories distorts their features.

The subjects choose the photos themselves, said Melnitchenko, who features his friends, fiancée, and son in a conceptual photography project, ""Tattoos of war.""

The photo — either taken by the subjects or sourced on news websites — represents the most painful memory they associate with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that began in February 2022. After more than three years of relentless Russian attacks on the country that have killed tens of thousands of people, Ukrainians face no shortage of such memories.

""It is an impossible task, in fact,"" Melnitchenko told the Kyiv Independent. ""Because everyone has hundreds of these memories. You have to choose one, as if to convince yourself that this event was the most difficult, the most tragic. Although every event that concerns our country during the war is the worst.""

For Melnitchenko, each photo from the project carries the weight of events that he and his subjects can still hardly comprehend.

One of the most challenging portraits for him was a photo of his friends Maryna and Serhii against the backdrop of the Mykolaiv Regional State Administration in their native city, destroyed by a Russian missile on March 29, 2022.

As a result of the attack, the central section of the building collapsed from the ninth to the first floor, killing 37 people. Maryna and Serhii fled the city a year ago, but the memory — a “tattoo” — will stay with them forever, Melnitchenko says in his photo book about the project.

But during the last shoot from the series at the end of 2024 with the family of Andrii, Viktoria, and their daughter Kira, Melnitchenko witnessed for the first time how one could transform their tragic memories into a source of strength.

The family chose a photo of a beach with pine trees on a riverbank of the Dnipro River, where they loved spending time before the full-scale invasion began.

Russia currently occupies this beach in Kakhovka, Kherson region. But even under occupation, the vision from the photograph is probably long gone, as Russia’s destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant’s dam reshaped the water terrain in the oblast.

According to the photographer, the family found it therapeutic to process the loss of their favorite place by visually exposing its impact.

""When Russians destroy our favorite places, or places of our memories, they are trying to take away not only this place physically, but also our good memories of them,"" Melnitchenko said.

""This family was the first of all the heroes to choose not a photo of devastation as a background, but a photo with a place of their strength and pleasant memories,"" he added.

Editor's note: This story is being updated and contains graphic images.

Russian forces attacked downtown Sumy in Ukraine's northeast on June 3, killing four people and injuring 28 others, including three children, according to Ukrainian authorities.

According to preliminary reports, Russia launched five attacks on Sumy using multiple launch rocket systems.

""The Russians launched a savage strike on Sumy — directly targeting the city and its ordinary streets with rocket artillery. It was a fully deliberate attack on civilians,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X.

A 17-year-old was among the injured, with authorities describing the condition of many victims as serious.

At nearly 4:30 p.m. local time, the death toll rose to four after a 43-year-old man who was in a serious condition died in the hospital. His seven-year-old daughter was also severely injured in the Russian attack.

The attack reportedly set two cars ablaze, destroying them completely. A medical facility and residential buildings were also damaged.

At 7 p.m. local time, rescuers finished working at the sites of the attacks. Sappers also examined the affected area and removed the remains of explosives, the State Emergency Service reported.

Local authorities declared June 3 and 4 a day of mourning in Sumy.

According to Zelensky, at least one of the projectiles used by Russia in the attack on Sumy failed to detonate, piercing the wall of a nine-story apartment building.

""That alone says everything one needs to know about Russia’s so-called 'desire' to end this war,"" he added, calling on the U.S. and Europe to increase pressure on Moscow.

The attack came only a day after Russia and Ukraine held a second round of talks in Istanbul on June 2, which focused on a new prisoner exchange, but yet again failed to achieve a breakthrough in peace efforts.

Russia proposed a limited two- to three-day ceasefire in specific front-line areas to recover the bodies of fallen soldiers, while continuing to disregard Ukraine’s call for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire supported by Western partners.

Sumy Oblast, which borders Russia to the north, has been a repeated target of Russian incursions and shelling since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. The region has recently seen renewed hostilities as Russian forces ramp up activity along the northeastern border.

In late May, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia is accumulating 50,000 troops near Sumy Oblast, seeking to create a 10-kilometer buffer zone in the area.

A trilateral meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to be organized in the near future, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on June 3, Russian-state media outlet TASS reported.

The Kremlin's statement comes a day after the White House said that Trump would not rule out participating in this format of talks.

""Frankly speaking, it is unlikely that (it will happen) soon,"" Peskov said in response to a question about whether the three leaders would meet in the near future.

Peskov added that Putin had already expressed his readiness for a high-level meeting, but that it must result from agreements reached at ""the technical and expert stages.""

Putin had previously said he was ready to meet with Zelensky. However, when the Ukrainian leader invited him to hold the highest-level talks in Turkey on May 16, Putin did not attend.

Consequently, Ukraine and Russia held their first direct talks since 2022, but at a lower level than planned, without the participation of the countries' leaders.

The Russian and Ukrainian delegations held the second round of talks in Istanbul on June 2, failing to reach a ceasefire. But the parties agreed to a new prisoner exchange, as well as the repatriation of 6,000 bodies of fallen Ukrainian soldiers.

The number of Russian citizens who support peace talks and an end to the war in Ukraine has reached a record high since the start of the full-scale invasion, according to a poll by the independent Russian pollster Levada Center published on June 2.

Some 64% of the respondents favored peace talks, representing a 6% increase since March. Meanwhile, the number of people who supported the war's continuation decreased from 34% in March to 28% in May.

Compared to previous survey results, in May 2023, 48% of respondents believed that the war should continue. In May 2024, this figure dropped to 43%.

The news comes after the second round of direct peace talks between Ukraine and Russia occurred in Istanbul. The parties agreed on a new prisoner exchange, as well as the repatriation of 6,000 bodies of fallen Ukrainian soldiers. No agreement on a ceasefire was reached.

The share of supporters of peaceful negotiations is higher among women (73%), people under 24 (77%), residents of villages and towns with populations under 100,000 (67% each), as well as those who believe that the country is going in the wrong direction (76%) and those who disapprove of Russian President Vladimir Putin's presidential performance (77%).

The share of those who support continuing the war is higher among men (39%), respondents aged 55 and older (35%), residents of Moscow (40%), those who believe that things in the country are going in the right direction (32%), and those who approve of the activities of the current president (30%).

A majority of respondents (73%) believe that Russia and Ukraine should address the hostilities' root causes and only then agree on a ceasefire. On the contrary, some 18% think that the parties will first reach a truce and ceasefire and then resolve all other issues.

Only 3% of Russians believe Russia is an obstacle to peace. At the same time, 14% of respondents believe that the U.S. is to blame, while 36% each see Ukraine and European countries as major obstacles in peace negotiations.

Ukraine hit 41 Russian military aircraft during Operation Spiderweb, Ukraine's General Staff said on June 3.

""After processing additional information from various sources and verifying it, which took some time, we inform you that the total losses of the occupiers amounted to 41 military aircraft, including strategic bombers and other types of combat aircraft,"" it said in a statement posted on social media.

It gave no further details on the type of aircraft hit or the extent of the damage caused to them.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) operation, dubbed ""Spiderweb,"" allegedly destroyed or damaged A-50, Tu-95, and Tu-22 M3 planes parked at the Belaya, Diaghilev, Olenya, and Ivanovo air bases on June 1.

Kyiv has claimed it had disabled 34% of Russia's strategic bomber fleet in what is seen as one of the most daring operations during the full-scale war. The strike reportedly involved 117 drones launched from trucks hidden across Russian territory.

Ukraine has pioneered drone technology during Russia's full-scale war, introducing various ground-, air-, and sea-based models for combat and reconnaissance missions.

Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on May 30 that Ukrainian soldiers hit and destroyed in May more than 89,000 Russian targets using drones of various types.

Ukraine is working to scale up domestic production. Kyiv has also developed long-range missile-drone hybrids, including the Palianytsia and Peklo models, which use turbojet engines as cruise missile alternatives.

By the end of 2024, Ukraine had developed a total of 324 new types of weapons, according to the Ministry of Strategic Industries.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/June-1-SBU.png

Russia's production of ballistic missiles has increased by at least 66% over the past year, according to data from Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) shared with the Kyiv Independent.

According to data obtained by HUR, Moscow is now producing 60 to 70 Iskander-M — the ballistic version of the missile — and 10 to 15 hypersonic Kinzhals per month.

This compares to a reported 40 Iskander-Ms in May 2024, and a reported 4–5 Kinzhals in April 2024.

At the lower range, this is an increase in production of 66.67%. At the higher range, 88.89%.

Russian monthly missile production (Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)

Ballistic attacks on Ukraine have become more deadly in recent months as stockpiles of air defense missiles, particularly for U.S.-made Patriots, have dwindled.

The figures shared with the Kyiv Independent show Russian stockpiles of ""almost 600 Iskander-Ms"" and ""over 100"" Kinzhals.

At the end of 2022, Military Intelligence Chief Kyrylo Budanov claimed Russia was almost out of Iskander ballistic missiles. By December 2024, HUR spokesperson Andriy Yusov noted that Russia had increased production to somewhere between 40 and 50 Iskander missiles per month.

Russia’s expanded production is a cause for alarm in Ukraine.

If HUR's figures are correct, Russia’s production of ballistic missiles today outnumbers total production of PAC-3 MSE missiles for Patriot air defense systems, the preferred anti-ballistic defenses for much of Europe, which Lockheed Martin hopes to boost to 650 per year by 2027.

Other Western systems like the SAMP/T and IRIS-T have not proved effective against ballistic missiles.

Russia has moreover reportedly outfitted the newest Iskanders with radar decoys and less predictable flight paths, making them harder to shoot down even with Patriot systems.

Russian missile stockpiles (Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)

Ukraine’s military intelligence has also estimated that Russia is holding a stockpile of 60 North Korean KN-23s. These missiles are similar to the Iskander-Ms, but carry a one-ton warhead, more powerful than their Russian equivalents.

The figures shared with the Kyiv Independent further show that total production for cruise missiles has also continued to grow.

Russia can produce 20 to 30 Iskander-Ks, 60 to 70 X-101s, 25 to 30 Kalibrs, up to 10 X-32s and 20-30 Onyx and Zircon anti-ship missiles.

A massive Ukrainian attack on Russian airfields on June 1 may have restricted Russia’s ability to launch several of these cruise missiles.

Tu-95M3s often carry Kh-55/Kh-555 or the newer Kh-101 and Kh-102 air-launched cruise missiles. The Tu-22 carries the Kh-22 missiles.Both of these types of aircraft are among those reported to have been damaged in Ukraine's Operation Spiderweb.

During wartime, Ukraine has also built out its production of its own cruise and ballistic missiles.

But large-scale production of types of missiles depend on major industrial zones that often fall victim to Russian air strikes — particularly when limited air defenses are being rationed.

Ukrainian citizen Roman Lavrynovych, suspected of setting fire to property linked to U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, may have been recruited by Russia via the Telegram messaging app, RFE/RL's Schemes investigative project reported on June 3.

Two properties and a car linked to Starmer were targeted in arson attacks in the first half of May.

Lavrynovych, a 21-year-old working as a model and a roofer, was charged on May 15. He allegedly set a car that Starmer previously sold to a neighbor on fire on May 8. The suspect also allegedly started fires at Starmer's two former residences on May 11 and 12.

The police said the property suffered damage, but no one was injured.

An analysis of Lavrynovych’s social media activity revealed that between 2022 and 2025, he actively searched for work through various Telegram channels aimed at foreigners in London. His most recent job-seeking post appeared in the London UA group on May 2, days before a car linked to Starmer was set ablaze in London.

""Looking for a job, I will consider any options,"" Lavrynovych wrote.

Soon after, a user named Yurii replied, asking Lavrynovych to message him privately. Yurii had joined London UA only a few days prior to the dialog, according to Schemes.

Another Ukrainian citizen, Petro Pochynok, was charged with conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life, is expected to appear at Westminster magistrates’ court on May 21.

Stanislav Carpiuc, a Russian-speaking Romanian national born in Ukraine, was also charged with conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life.

British security officials are currently investigating possible Russian involvement in the attacks, the Financial Times reported on May 23.

Western officials have repeatedly accused Moscow of using covert sabotage, cyberattacks, and disinformation as part of its broader campaign to destabilize European nations that support Ukraine during the Russian large-scale war.

Russian ex-President Dmitry Medvedev's statement that Russia seeks only a ""swift victory"" and the ""complete destruction"" of the Ukrainian government at the Istanbul peace talks is a ""rare moment of honesty,"" U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham said on June 3.

""I appreciate you making it clear to the world that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and Russia are not remotely interested in peace,"" said Graham, a Republican lawmaker backing a bill on major new sanctions against Russia.

Graham made the statement in reaction to Medvedev's Telegram post, in which the deputy chairman of the Russian security council admitted that ""the Istanbul negotiations are not intended for reaching a compromise peace based on someone's unrealistic conditions.""

Russia and Ukraine held the second round of peace negotiations on June 2, during which Russia yet again rejected a long-term ceasefire and instead presented a memorandum with a list of harsh demands on Kyiv.

These reportedly included official recognition of Russia's occupation of Ukrainian territories, Ukraine's full withdrawal from four partially occupied regions, a ban on joining NATO, limits on the military, and more conditions.

Moscow's real goal in the talks is a ""swift victory and the complete destruction"" of the Ukrainian government, Medvedev said. He referred to Ukrainian authorities as a ""neo-Nazi regime,"" referring to Russia's false narratives about the Nazi-led government in Kyiv that were used as a pretext for Russian aggression.

""This is the meaning of the Russian memorandum published yesterday (June 2)."" Medvedev has gained notoriety during the full-scale war for his theatrical and incendiary remarks aimed at Ukraine and its Western partners.

Ukraine has repeatedly accused Moscow of intentionally stalling the negotiations to allow its forces to take more territory in the meantime.

""Our army is actively advancing and will continue to advance. Everything that should explode will explode, and everybody who should be exterminated will disappear,"" Medvedev said.

During the talks in Istanbul, the Ukrainian delegation also presented a peace proposal, which included a prisoner swap in an all-for-all format, the return of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia, as well as the release of all civilians held in Russian captivity.

According to the Ukrainian proposal seen by the Kyiv Independent, Kyiv would retain its right to join the EU and NATO. Ukraine also highlighted the need for security guarantees to avoid further Russian invasion.

Like the first round of talks on May 16, this week's negotiations ended without any tangible progress toward a long-term ceasefire or a peace deal. Instead, the two parties agreed on a new prisoner exchange, which could involve up to 1,200 prisoners on each side.

Moscow also proposed a brief ceasefire lasting up to three days to collect the bodies of fallen soldiers.

President Volodymyr Zelensky called upon U.S. President Donald Trump to adopt tougher sanctions against Russia if the Istanbul talks fail to achieve progress. A bipartisan bill proposed by Graham, which he said will ""start moving"" forward this week, would impose 500% tariffs on imports from countries purchasing Russian oil, gas, uranium, and other products.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/GettyImages-2189238195--1-.jpg

New air defense units will be established to counter Russia’s drone attacks on Ukraine, Air Force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat said in an interview with Ukrainska Pravda on June 2.

Despite ongoing peace talks, Russia continues to reject calls for an unconditional ceasefire, intensifying drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, killing and injuring civilians.

Overnight on June 1, Russia launched an aerial assault on Ukraine, deploying a record 472 drones.

Ukrainian forces downed 210 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, while 172 more drones were intercepted by electronic warfare or disappeared from radars, according to the Air Force.

""We would have liked to have had better results, but there were still dozens of hits,"" Ihant said.

According to Ihant, Russia employed tactics involving the launch of a large number of weapons at a single target that approached from high altitude. During their meeting on June 2, air force commanders emphasized the urgent need to strengthen drone air defense capabilities, he said.

""We are talking about anti-aircraft drones that help intercept air targets. Crews are being trained in different locations on the territory of our country. New units will be introduced,"" the spokesperson said.

Russia seeks to produce up to 500 drones per day, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in late May.

Meanwhile, Ukraine has more than doubled its long-range drone production in 2024 compared to the previous year—a staggering 22-fold increase since 2022.

A recent Ukrainian drone strike deep inside Russian territory has sparked anger and concern among Kremlin officials over the exposed vulnerability of a nuclear-capable air force far from the front lines, Bloomberg reported on June 2, citing undisclosed sources close to senior Moscow officials.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) carried out the operation ""Spiderweb"" on June 1, targeting Russian air bases at Belaya, Diaghilev, Olenya, and Ivanovo with drones hidden in trucks across Russia.

The strike is claimed to have hit 41 aircraft, including Tu-95 and Tu-22 bombers. These planes belong to Russia's nuclear-capable air fleet and are used to launch cruise missile attacks on Ukraine's cities.

Ukraine's General Staff said in its daily update on June 3 that Russian forces lost 12 aircraft, without elaborating on the types of destroyed planes or whether more had been damaged.

Meanwhile, a source close to the Kremlin told Bloomberg that the number of affected aircraft may be closer to 10. According to the outlet’s sources, only a small number of the targeted Russian bombers are required for strikes against Ukraine, meaning the pace of missile and bombing attacks is unlikely to slow.

The SBU claimed the operation caused approximately $7 billion in damage and disabled one-third of Russia's cruise missile bombers.

The Ukrainian parliament supported a bill on establishing the institution of a military ombudsman in the first reading on June 3, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said.

The legislation was supported by 287 lawmakers, with 25 abstaining and none voting against it. Bills must pass two readings and be signed by the president before becoming law.

Ukraine first unveiled the office in April 2024 to ensure soldiers had a mechanism to report violations of their rights.

The military ombudsman ""will be responsible for considering appeals and complaints of service members, providing primary legal assistance, conducting inspections, and investigating violations of the rights of service members and their family members,"" the Defense Ministry said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has tapped Olha Reshetylova, formerly a journalist and human rights activist, as the first military ombudsman.

The Military Ombudsman Office will be established as a civilian oversight body over the security and defense sector. The legislation also establishes procedures for military personnel to submit complaints and for the inspection of military units.

As Ukraine entered the fourth year of the full-scale war with Russia, several units have faced accusations of misconduct and abuse within their ranks.

Most recently, the French-trained 155th ""Anne of Kyiv"" Brigade is under investigation for alleged involvement of its command in handing out falsified bonus payments and demanding bribes.

Last December, the commander of the 211th Pontoon Bridge Brigade was detained for failing to address abuse and torture allegations involving his subordinates.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2155584026.jpg

Ukraine has been invited to the upcoming NATO summit in The Hague between June 24 and 25, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a June 2 online press conference attended by the Kyiv Independent.

""We were invited to the NATO summit. I think this is important,"" Zelensky said, adding that he held a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte during the Vilnius summit of the Bucharest Nine (B9) and the Nordic countries on June 2.

""Now, (Foreign Minister Andrii) Sybiha will be speaking with his colleagues regarding infrastructure and what potential outcomes may arise from this summit in The Hague.""

Zelensky did not specify who would be representing Ukraine at the summit or whether he would attend the event himself.

The statement follows speculations that the allies decided not to invite Ukraine to the annual summit due to opposition from U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio later denied the claims, and the Netherlands said it would welcome Zelensky's attendance.

At the previous NATO summit in Washington in 2024, Zelensky was a prominent presence, engaging directly with allied leaders. This year, the tone appears more cautious as NATO members weigh how to handle Ukraine's future in the alliance amid renewed questions about U.S. commitment.

Trump has claimed that Ukraine provoked the war by pursuing NATO membership, a narrative often used by Russian propaganda to justify its 2022 full-scale invasion. He also signaled plans to reduce U.S. military presence in Europe and has been reluctant to provide new military support to Kyiv.

U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson voiced support on June 2 for a Senate-backed bill aimed at strengthening sanctions against Russia, the New York Post reported.

A bipartisan group of U.S. senators said in late May that they are ready to vote on a bill on sanctions against Russia if peace talks on the Russia-Ukraine war do not progress soon.

The bill, introduced to the Senate in early April, would impose new penalties on Russia and slap 500% tariffs on imports from countries that buy Russian oil, petroleum products, natural gas, or uranium.

""There's many members of Congress that want us to sanction Russia as strongly as we can,"" Johnson said. ""And I'm an advocate of that.""

U.S. President Donald Trump said he had not yet imposed new sanctions on Russia because he believed a peace deal might be within reach.

""If I think I'm close to getting a deal, I don't want to screw it up by doing that,"" he said, but added he is prepared to act if Moscow stalls further.

Russia and Ukraine held a second round of talks in Istanbul on June 2. Kyiv presented a peace proposal that reportedly included potential easing of sanctions on Moscow, among other clauses.

The condition proposed by Ukraine is that sanctions are automatically renewed if the ceasefire agreement is broken.

Following the new round of talks, Russia proposed a limited two- to three-day ceasefire in specific front-line areas to recover the bodies of fallen soldiers, while continuing to disregard Ukraine’s call for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire supported by Western partners.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/GettyImages-2216492433.jpg

Editor's note: The story was updated after the Ukrainian delegation arrived in the U.S.

A Ukrainian delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko and including Andriy Yermak, head of the Presidential Office, arrived in Washington on June 3, Yermak said.

The delegation will discuss ""defense support, the battlefield situation, and strengthening sanctions against Russia, namely Senator (Lindsey) Graham's bill,"" Yermak said on Telegram.

The parties will also discuss efforts to bring abducted Ukrainian children back from Russia, a U.S.-Ukrainian minerals agreement, Russian propaganda connected to Ukrainian churches, and recent peace talks in Istanbul, Yermak added.

The trip comes after President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on June 2 that Ukraine seeks defense agreements and a free trade deal with Washington.

""I discussed this with President (Donald) Trump... We want to buy (weapons.) This is what the agreement is about – no gifts,"" Zelensky said.

The Trump administration has not approved any new major military aid packages for Ukraine, and the assistance allocated under the previous Biden administration is steadily running out. Zelensky's team has therefore offered Washington to buy U.S. weapons instead of receiving them as donations.

The visit also follows the second round of Russian-Ukrainian peace talks in Istanbul on June 2, which focused on a new prisoner exchange but yet again failed to achieve a breakthrough in peace efforts.

Zelensky has urged Trump to impose additional sanctions on Russia if the peace talks stall.

""If the Istanbul meeting brings nothing, that clearly means strong new sanctions are urgently needed — from the EU's 18th package, and from the United States specifically, the strongest sanctions President Trump promised,"" Zelensky said on June 2.

Trump said on May 28 that the U.S. would soon know whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is serious about ending the war. If not, he warned, Washington would ""respond a little bit differently.""

The U.S. president also said last month he had not yet imposed new sanctions on Russia because he believed a peace deal might be within reach. ""If I think I'm close to getting a deal, I don't want to screw it up by doing that,"" he said, but added he is prepared to act if Moscow stalls further.

This week, the U.S. Senate is expected to ""start moving"" forward a new bill backed by Senator Graham that would impose 500% tariffs on imports from countries purchasing Russian oil, gas, uranium, and other products.

Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, who led the Ukrainian delegation in Istanbul, slammed Russia for ""once again stalling for time.""

Rejecting Kyiv's offer of a long-term truce, Russia only proposed a temporary two- to three-day ceasefire in specific areas of the front line to allow for the retrieval of fallen soldiers' bodies.

Latest: Ukraine confirms 41 Russian aircraft including bombers hit during Operation Spiderweb.

Russian forces lost 12 aircraft, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said in its regular daily update on June 3, without providing additional details.

The report came two days after the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) launched a mass drone attack against Russian strategic aviation parked at four different air bases on June 1.

SBU chief Vasyl Maliuk said that 41 planes, including Tu-95 and Tu-22 M3 bombers and A-50 reconnaissance planes, were hit. The SBU later claimed the operation caused approximately $7 billion in damage and disabled one-third of Russia's cruise missile bombers.

In its report, the General Staff did not specify the types of destroyed planes or whether more had been damaged.

Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council official Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation, previously said at least 13 Russian aircraft were destroyed in the attack, with more damaged.

""This was not just a devastating blow to enemy aviation, but a serious slap in the face of the power and terrorist essence of the Russian Federation,"" Maliuk said in a statement on June 2.

Russian officials and propagandists have chosen different strategies for dealing with the unprecedented Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian airfields that took place on June 1.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said that, as part of an operation dubbed Spiderweb, it had destroyed or damaged 41 Russian aircraft parked at the Belaya, Dyagilevo, Olenya, and Ivanovo air bases on June 1.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the number of aircraft hit by the SBU.

Kyiv has claimed it had disabled 34% of Russia's strategic bomber fleet in what is seen as one of the most daring operations during the full-scale war. The strike reportedly involved 117 drones launched from trucks hidden across Russian territory.

Russian top officials, including President Vladimir Putin, did not comment on the Ukrainian operation at all, while some pro-war propagandists tried to downplay its scale.

Other propagandists threatened to take revenge on Ukraine and the West by launching nuclear strikes and attacking airfields in NATO countries.

But some pro-war bloggers were more skeptical, saying that the attacks were a ""Russian Pearl Harbor"" — a reference to the devastating Japanese strikes on the U.S. naval base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in 1941. These bloggers argued that the Russian authorities should not lie about the attacks and must draw conclusions to prevent similar incidents in the future.

""Russia's nuclear threats don't look serious after it became clear that you can deprive Russia of a large part of its nuclear potential using drones and trucks,"" Russian anti-Kremlin columnist Sergei Parkhomenko told the Kyiv Independent in a reference to nuclear-capable strategic bombers allegedly destroyed by Ukraine.

Downplaying attacks

Russia's Defense Ministry presented the Ukrainian strikes as ""a terrorist attack"" by the ""Kyiv regime"" — an odd claim, given that the operation targeted exclusively military facilities, not civilians.

The ministry claimed that ""all terrorist attacks were repelled"" and that ""several pieces of aircraft equipment caught fire.""

""The fires have been extinguished,"" the ministry said. ""There are no casualties among military personnel or civilian staff.""

The Defense Ministry also claimed that ""some of the perpetrators of the attacks have been detained.""

Some pro-war bloggers also chose to downplay the scale of the Ukrainian attacks.

""I spoke with people in the know, and they say that, while the reputational damage is certainly significant, the material loss is not,"" pro-war propagandist Alexei Zhivov wrote on Telegram. ""The forces and resources needed to continue the military campaign are available. Fundamentally, nothing will change.""

He added that Ukrainian ""bombardments can't bring anyone to their knees.""

Issuing threats

One of the country's top propagandists, Vladimir Solovyov, said during his TV show that the Ukrainian operation was ""grounds for a nuclear attack"" and called for conducting strikes on Ukraine's president's office on Bankova Street in Kyiv and airfields in Poland and Romania allegedly used by Ukrainian aircraft.

Commenting on the publication of footage from the Russian airfields by soldiers during the Ukrainian attacks, Solovyov called for introducing ""the most severe military censorship"" to crack down on such videos.

Margarita Simonyan, chief editor of the Kremlin's English-language TV network Russia Today, said on Solovyov's show that ""revenge"" for the Ukrainian attacks was ""inevitable"" and hinted that those responsible would be executed.

Critical pro-war bloggers

Some pro-war propagandists, however, were critical of the Russian authorities.

""This day will later be called a black day for Russia's long-range aviation,"" the pro-war blogger with the nickname Fighter Bomber wrote on Telegram.

Commenting on containers from which the Ukrainian drones were launched, Fighter Bomber wrote that ""you really had to work hard to screw up and miss such containers.""

""But we managed,"" he added.

Fighter Bomber also quipped that they expected the Russian authorities to reward those who failed to protect the airfields rather than to punish them, alluding to the widespread nepotism and corruption in the Russian army.

Meanwhile, the pro-war blogger Starshe Eddy (""older than the Edda"") dismissed claims by other propagandists that the operation was carried out by Western intelligence rather than by Ukrainians.

""If the British, using the hands of these so-called 'dumb' Ukrainians, managed to hit us like this — then what should we expect from a direct confrontation with the British themselves?"" the pro-war blogger said on Telegram.

""The Ukrainians are not dumb at all. They've been at war with us for three and a half years, carrying out subtle, clever, and daring operations. Today's tragedy will go down in the textbooks of intelligence services — including our own.""

He added that ""British intelligence is directly involved in the war, but let's not once again cover up our own failures by blaming everything on the British.""

""As one wise man once said: if you publicly shit yourself, you should apologize, wash your ass, and change your clothes — not walk around a public place with your pants full of shit pretending nothing happened,"" the blogger continued.

Another propagandist, Alexander Kots, urged Russians to stop distorting information about Ukrainian attacks.

""It's important to tell the truth now, no matter how bitter it may be,"" he wrote. ""We'll win the war anyway. We just have to stop lying to ourselves.""

Won't move the needle

Another group of critics of the Russian authorities' actions were the people who call themselves the opposition to Putin's regime.

Anti-Kremlin columnist Parkhomenko said that some officials would likely be fired due to their failure to prevent the attacks, but the Kremlin would try to avoid making any public connection between such dismissals and the Ukrainian operation.

He also told the Kyiv Independent that Russia was likely to launch some revenge attacks against Ukraine.

Parkomenko believes the attacks will also have an impact on Russia's relations with NATO countries since he thinks Western intelligence agencies likely took part in the operation.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has denied such claims, saying that Ukraine had carried out the attack singlehandedly without the assistance of Western intelligence services.

Moreover, Russia's position in negotiations with the West has also been weakened due to the strikes, he added.

Parkhomenko said, however, that the attacks were unlikely to deal a major blow to Putin's reputation among the population or the Russian elite.

Russian propaganda is downplaying the damage, and those who like or hate Putin are unlikely to change their opinions, Parkhomenko said.

He added that Ukraine's unprecedented incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast had not had a major impact on Putin's popularity either.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/GettyImages-2179411079.jpg

Russian attacks against Ukraine killed at least seven civilians and injured 42 others over the past day, regional authorities said on June 3.

Ukrainian forces downed 60 out of the 112 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported.

Fifteen drones were intercepted by electronic warfare or disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement.

Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are usually decoys. Russia launches them alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine's air defense.

A Ukrainian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Russian-occupied parts of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts overnight on June 3 caused widespread blackouts, according to Russian occupation authorities.

The U.K. government is ready to sue sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich over the sale of the Chelsea Football Club, U.K. Treasury Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in a joint statement on June 2.

""The government is determined to see the proceeds from the sale of Chelsea Football Club reach humanitarian causes in Ukraine, following Russia's illegal full-scale invasion,"" the two officials said.

Lammy, on March 9, vowed to unfreeze billions of dollars of revenue earned from Abramovich's sale of the Chelsea Football Club and use the funds to support Ukraine.

Abramovich was forced to sell Chelsea FC when sanctions were enacted against him following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

""While the door for negotiations will remain open, we are fully prepared to pursue this through the courts if required,"" Reeves and Lammy said in their joint statement.

The U.K. government previously said that the funds intended to help Ukraine remained in limbo due to a disagreement between officials and Abramovich.

2.3 billion pounds ($3.1 billion) are currently frozen in a dedicated trust as officials decide how to obtain and utilize the funds.

Defense Minister Rustem Umerov on June 2 slammed Russia for only providing its memorandum of a peace proposal at talks earlier in the day, saying that ""the Russians are once again stalling for time.""

""(I)f this is just another attempt to buy time, then there should be one response: tougher international sanctions,"" Umerov said in a post to Facebook.

""Our documents were submitted in advance. In contrast, the Russian 'memorandum' appeared only today — during the meeting itself. This created conditions that prevented the meeting from delivering the results needed to end the war,"" he added.

Ukraine and Russia held another round of peace talks on June 2, after their first meeting in Istanbul on May 16. Both rounds of talks were largely inconclusive, with Russia reiterating its rejection of a ceasefire.

Umerov attended the peace negotiations in Istanbul on June 2, leading Ukraine's 14-member delegation, which included several figures from Ukraine's military, human rights, and legal sectors. Umerov also led Ukraine's 12-member delegation on May 16.

""We conveyed the positions formulated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. One of the key points — an unconditional ceasefire for at least 30 days. This has been our principle and the position of our partners for many months,"" Umerov said.

Russia only proposed a temporary two- to three-day ceasefire in specific areas of the front line to allow for the retrieval of fallen soldiers' bodies.

""Russia rejects even the very idea of stopping the killings. That’s why we appeal to the world: pressure is needed for real peace, not for an imitation of negotiations,"" Umerov said.

At the first round of peace talks, both sides agreed to a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange, which took place from May 23-25.

On June 2, Ukraine and Russia agreed to work on another prisoner exchange with up to 1,200 captives from each side.

Zelensky, later on June 2, criticized Russia’s proposal for a 2–3-day local ceasefire to retrieve the bodies of fallen soldiers, speaking during an online press conference attended by the Kyiv Independent.

Zelensky earlier on June 2 called on U.S. President Donald Trump to deliver a ""strong new package"" of sanctions against Russia if peace talks in Istanbul remain unsuccessful.

""If the Istanbul meeting brings nothing, that clearly means strong new sanctions are urgently needed — from the EU's 18th package, and from the United States specifically, the strongest sanctions President Trump promised,"" Zelensky said.

""Every part of society, every citizen of this country, has a role to play because we have to recognize that things have changed in the world of today... The front line, if you like, is here,"" Starmer said.

""We face war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyberattacks, growing Russian aggression in our waters, menacing our skies,"" he added.

The media reported on June 1 that a defense review would recommend increasing the U.K.'s military spending and introducing new equipment, including jets capable of launching tactical nuclear weapons.

The British military has a substantial nuclear arsenal, but can only launch such weapons from its submarines after decommissioning a number of platforms at the end of the Cold War.

Starmer announced a wide range of new defense spending commitments amid the increased threat Russia poses to Euro-Atlantic security.

Twelve new nuclear submarines are set to be built within the framework of the Aukus partnership with the U.K, U.S., and Australia.

The U.K. plans to boost weapons production and increase stockpiles, including plans to produce 7,000 long-range weapons and six new munitions factories.

Weapons spending is set to increase by 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) to a total of 6 billion pounds ($8.1 billion). Another 15 billion pounds ($20 billion) will be invested in the U.K's nuclear warhead program.

""The threat we now face is more serious, more immediate and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War,"" Starmer said.

NATO officials have increasingly warned that Russia could attack the alliance's eastern flank in the coming years amid Russia's war against Ukraine.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that during the Istanbul negotiations, Russian representatives dismissed the issue of abducted Ukrainian children as a ""show for childless European old ladies"" and acknowledged deporting several hundred children.

""I want our journalists, our people — and not only ours — to understand their attitude toward the humanitarian aspect. First, they told us not to ‘put on a show for childless European old ladies’ — that’s how they phrased it in Russian. That’s their attitude when we raise the issue of the children,"" Zelensky noted during an online press conference attended by the Kyiv Independent.

During the second round of peace talks in Istanbul on June 2, Vladimir Medinsky, aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin and head of Russia's delegation, presented a list submitted by Ukraine containing the names of 339 children it says were abducted by Russia and must be returned.

Medinsky rejected the allegations, denying that Russia had taken the children by force.

Ukraine has documented over 19,500 cases of children who were forcibly taken to Russia, Belarus, or occupied territories since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. According to official figures, only about 1,300 of them have been brought back to areas under Ukrainian control.

These actions have faced widespread international backlash.

In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Putin and the country's commissioner for children’s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, over their alleged roles in organizing the deportations.

More recently, the European Parliament passed a resolution denouncing the deportations as part of a ""genocidal strategy"" to eliminate Ukrainian identity, calling for the immediate and unconditional return of all abducted children.

""We told them they had stolen 20,000 children, and they responded that it wasn’t 20,000 — at most, they said, it was a matter of a few hundred,"" Zelensky said. ""Our delegation (was) offended by this... Honestly, I’m not. I think it’s more important not to fixate on the number, but on the fact itself — they admitted to taking children. We believe it’s thousands, they say it’s hundreds, but what matters is that they acknowledged the fact.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GGzUHyPasAUpX7n.jpg

Norway will help Ukraine cover a potential one billion euro ($1.08 billion) gas deficit, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced following a meeting with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store in Vilnius on June 2.

""We discussed issues that are important for Ukraine right now. I received a positive signal from him. This concerns gas: if we face a deficit in winter, can we count on the appropriate volume? Today, I received support from Jonas (Gahr Store),"" Zelensky said.

Russian forces regularly attack Ukraine's energy infrastructure, leading to power and heat shortages across the country. Russia attacked 34 facilities of Ukrgasvydobuvannya, Ukraine's largest gas producer and part of the state Naftogaz Group, last winter, leading to a loss of almost 50% of gas production, the company reported on April 21.

""We agreed that we will look for opportunities to close any deficit, which may arise if everything is not restored (Ukrainian gas production infrastructure affected by Russian attacks), if we cannot fully provide our population with gas,"" Zelensky noted during an online press conference attended by the Kyiv Independent.

""And therefore there is an appropriate volume. We have found half, but we were missing another half. I'll put it this way: we're talking about a volume worth a billion euros — that's what I'm discussing with the Norwegian prime minister.""

The two leaders have also discussed continued support for Kyiv, including strengthening the country’s air defense, encouraging direct investment in Ukraine’s defense industry, specifucally the drone production, and increasing pressure on Russia.

Norway is ranked 11th in the world in terms of the amount of aid provided to Ukraine, having so far provided over $4.5 billion in humanitarian, financial, and military support, according to the Kiel Institute's Ukraine Support Tracker.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on June 2 that Turkey plans to facilitate a meeting between the leaders of Russia and Ukraine in either Ankara or Istanbul. Speaking to reporters on the same day, President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed readiness to take part in such talks.

""I had a conversation with President Erdoğan of Turkey. And indeed, he sent a signal, asking how I would feel about a meeting of four leaders: himself, the President of the United States, Putin, and me. I told him that I support a meeting at the level of leaders, because I have the impression that there will be no ceasefire without our meeting,"" Zelensky said during an online press conference attended by the Kyiv Independent.

The president's comments followed another round of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul on June 2, where the sides agreed to a new prisoners of war (POWs) exchange but failed to reach a ceasefire.

The talks, hosted by Turkish officials, follow the first round of negotiations on May 16. The initial meeting ended with an agreement on the largest prisoner exchange of the war, but without any tangible progress toward a peace deal.

In the meantine, U.S. President Donald Trump is also open to an invitation by his Turkish counterpart to hold three-way peace talks in Turkey with the Russian and Ukrainian leaders, the White House said on June 2.

""The president has said he's open to it if it comes to that, but he wants both of these leaders and both sides to come to the table together,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters when asked about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's proposal.

Following the June 2 talks, Russia also proposed a temporary two- to three-day ceasefire in specific areas of the front line to allow for the retrieval of fallen soldiers' bodies, Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky said on June 2.

Zelensky criticized Russia’s proposal for a 2–3-day local ceasefire to retrieve the bodies of fallen soldiers, adding that ""they (the Russian side) just don’t see a ceasefire as such at the moment.""

""As they said regarding a ceasefire, they are ready for a 2–3-day ceasefire to retrieve the dead from the battlefield. I think they’re idiots, because, fundamentally, a ceasefire is meant so that there are no dead.""

Ukraine's largest private energy company DTEK secured a $72-million loan to build one of the largest battery energy storage complexes in Eastern Europe, the company said on June 3.

Ukraine’s second most profitable bank, state-owned Oschadbank, state-owned Ukrgasbank, and PUMB will provide the funding for the project, which includes six energy storage installations across the country, totaling 200 megawatts to power 600,000 households.

Battery energy storage facilities are like a large power bank connected to energy grids, and are crucial for storing energy created by renewables like solar and wind for later use. The share of renewable energy in Ukraine's grid was about 10% before Russia’s full-scale invasion. Kyiv wants to up this to 27% by 2030.

Other similar energy storage systems in Eastern Europe include Lithuanian electricity transmission system operator Litgrid's 200-MW units launched in 2023 and a 55-MW battery energy storage system in Razlog in southwestern Bulgaria that went online in 2024.

The loan — DTEK's largest domestic loan agreement to finance new energy infrastructure — covers part of the construction costs for five of the installations and runs until Sept. 25, 2030. DTEK, owned by Ukraine’s richest man Rinat Akhmetov, will cover the remaining costs. PUMB is majority-owned by Akhmetov via his System Capital Management (SCM) Holdings.

""DTEK’s investments in new energy capacity are not only a response to current challenges but also a contribution to the long-term strategy of ensuring Ukraine’s energy resilience and independence. Our goal is not just to restore but to create modern and reliable energy that will become the foundation for the country’s economic development,"" DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said.

Last year, DTEK lost 90% of its energy generation capacities due to Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. In total, Ukraine lost 9 gigawatts of its energy capacity, around half of the country’s peak winter consumption, which facilitated discussions on the need to decentralize its energy sources.

The company sees battery energy storage facilities as a path to decentralization and unification with the EU. In March, DTEK announced it was building Poland’s first large electricity storage facility as part of its plan to establish a pan-European energy system connected to Ukraine.

DTEK has continued to invest in energy projects in Ukraine, most notably committing 450 million euros ($468 million) to expand the Tyligulska Wind Power Plant near the Black Sea coast in cooperation with Denmark's state-owned Export and Investment Fund. It marked the largest ever private investment in Ukraine’s energy sector.

Unlike other state-owned energy companies in Ukraine, DTEK hasn’t been able to secure funding from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).

Cooperation with Ukrainian banks strengthens Ukraine’s energy security and potential, the company said.

""We recognize our responsibility as a bank that consistently supports the country, and we are doing everything we can to financially contribute to the development of new energy capacities. This is not just about investing in infrastructure — it’s about strengthening the strategic energy independence and security of our state,"" Serhiy Chernenko, Chairman of PUMB’s Board, said.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1255039162.jpg

A large-scale drone attack carried out by Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU), which reportedly destroyed or damaged 41 Russian heavy bombers on June 1, brought a much-needed morale boost to Ukrainians.

Codenamed ""Spiderweb,"" the operation targeted the strategic aircraft that Russia uses for long-range missile attacks on Ukrainian cities. The damage dealt could potentially hinder Moscow’s ability to carry out such mass strikes in the future.

In Ukraine, the operation quickly drew comparisons to some of the most uplifting moments since 2022 – including the sinking of the Black Sea Fleet’s flagship Moskva, the attack on the Crimean Bridge, and the surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk Oblast.

The timing couldn’t be more crucial, as Ukrainians have entered the fourth year of defending their country against Russia’s full-scale invasion, while Moscow’s attacks in the air and on the ground continue to intensify.

“I was shocked by this and could not believe that this could be done. It’s some kind of fantastic operation,” Volodymyr, a Kyiv resident, told the Kyiv Independent. “Any such operation brings us closer to victory.”

The operation had been in preparation for one and a half years. It used low-cost FPV (first-person view) drones that were smuggled into Russia and hidden inside trucks to attack four airfields across the country, two of them located thousands of miles away from Ukraine.

The success of the Ukrainian operation dealt a blow to the image of Russia’s security services, demonstrating that Ukraine can carry out effective attacks inside Russian territory without having forces on the ground.

“It shows the power of modern drones. And it's interesting, to say the least,” said Ivan Boichenko, a prospective university student from Kyiv. “I was very impressed. It was very uplifting, I would even say.”

President Volodymyr Zelensky said 117 drones were used in Operation Spiderweb. According to estimates from the SBU, the drone strike disabled 34% of Russia’s cruise missile bombers, causing approximately $7 billion in damage.

“We were very impressed and happy. We really hope (that the war is approaching) its end, and this will somehow help us to have a peaceful life like before. We miss those times very much,” said Alina, a pharmacist and a resident of Kryvyi Rih.

Asked whether she fears a possible Russian attack in retaliation for the Ukrainian operation, she says her city is already a frequent target of Russian attacks. On April 4, Russia’s missile strike killed 20 people there — including nine children.

Halyna, a medical worker from Kyiv, shares similar thoughts about possible Russian retaliation. She says Russia already strikes regularly.

“Every day — there’s no such day, not a minute, neither at night, nor during the day. Children are in basements, we are in corridors,” she says.

“I also suffered, there was an attack on us. God forbid anybody has to go through that,” she went on. “But you see, I’m alive, many of us are. Though, of course, even more are not. May our defenders rest in peace. Thanks to them, we’re still here.”

Russian forces launch drone, glide bomb, and artillery attacks targeting civilian areas in Ukraine on a daily basis. On June 2 alone, Russian strikes across the country killed at least nine civilians and injured at least 49, including children, according to the regional authorities.

Kyiv resident Volodymyr was among those who spent the night in a bomb shelter.

“When there was an air raid alarm, my family and I went to the shelter, because I was worried there would be some response, as usual, after such operations,” he told the Kyiv Independent.



Among those who spoke with the Kyiv Independent, there was a quiet sense that Ukraine, through actions like this, is not backing down.

“The point is, it is better to strike back. It is better than just sitting there with your hands folded,"" said Boichenko.

Many were also proud of the inventiveness of the operation.

“These moments should go down in history. There should be books, scientific works — the whole world should know about this,” said Halyna.

“This is happiness for us. They are destroying us, destroying us as people. And what did we do? We responded. We did the right thing. I’m glad,” she added.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/June-1-SBU.png

The Ukrainian and Russian delegations concluded peace talks in Istanbul on June 2, agreeing on a new prisoners of war (POWs) exchange but failing to reach a ceasefire.

The talks, hosted by Turkish officials, follow the first round of negotiations on May 16. The initial meeting ended with an agreement on the largest prisoner exchange of the war, but without any tangible progress toward a peace deal.

The parties agreed to conduct a major swap, which will include severely injured and young people aged 18 to 25.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the next prisoner exchange would feature at least 1,000 people on each side, and might reach a 1,200-for-1,200 swap that would possibly also include imprisoned journalists and political prisoners held in Russia.

After the talks, Russia pledged to transfer 6,000 bodies of fallen Ukrainian soldiers and officers to Ukraine and also proposed a ceasefire for two or three days in some areas of the front line in order to retrieve the bodies of the fallen soldiers.

""They just don’t see a ceasefire as such at the moment,"" Zelensky said of Russia's proposal. ""As they said regarding a ceasefire, they are ready for a 2–3-day ceasefire to retrieve the dead from the battlefield. I think they’re idiots, because, fundamentally, a ceasefire is meant so that there are no dead.""

""You can see their attitude. For them, this is just a brief pause in the war,"" the president added.

Zelensky said that only 15% of the mentioned 6,000 are identified and that Ukraine would need to check that the bodies Russia is willing to return are those of Ukrainian soldiers.

""We had instances when they returned bodies that later were identified as their own,"" Zelensky said on June 2.

Kyiv also handed over to the Russian delegation a list of 339 children abducted by Russia, and Moscow passed over its memorandum of proposals for a ceasefire. Ukraine submitted its document on May 28.

Following the talks, the Kyiv Independent obtained the text of the peace proposals that Ukraine presented to Russia in Istanbul.

According to the document, the Ukrainian delegation offered Moscow a complete ceasefire, the exchange of prisoners of war in an ""all-for-all format,"" bringing back the children abducted by Russia, and the release of all civilians from Russian captivity.

Ukraine called for guarantees that would prevent Russia from repeating its aggression, as well as the involvement of the international community to achieve this.

According to Ukraine's proposal seen by the Kyiv Independent, Ukraine will continue on its path toward joining the EU and will become a member of NATO if there is consensus within the alliance.

Ukraine is also ready to agree to the gradual lifting of some sanctions against Russia, but with a mechanism for their renewal if necessary. Frozen Russian assets, in turn, should be used to restore Ukraine and pay reparations.

Umerov was leading Ukraine's 14-member delegation, which includes several figures from Ukraine's military, human rights, and legal sectors who did not take part in the May 16 negotiations.

Before meeting with Russian officials, Umerov held a bilateral meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Suspilne reported.

Russian delegates were led by Medinsky, who represented Moscow both during the first unsuccessful peace talks in Istanbul in 2022 and then again in May this year.

Russia has not officially submitted its memorandum outlining peace terms, but Ukraine plans to present a detailed roadmap aimed at securing a lasting settlement.

Before the talks, Ukraine's First Deputy Foreign Minister Serhii Kyslytsia and Ukrainian delegation member Oleksandr Bevz met representatives from Germany, Italy, and the U.K. to coordinate their positions, Tykhyi said on X.

""Members of the Ukrainian delegation reiterated Ukraine’s commitment to peace efforts. They elaborated on the items of the agenda, which include leaders’ meeting, a full ceasefire, and humanitarian confidence-building measures,"" he added.

Security advisors from the U.S., U.K., France, and Germany also plan to attend the talks, according to U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg.

While the U.S. and Ukraine have pushed for an unconditional ceasefire, the Kremlin has rejected it.

Instead, Moscow has regularly voiced maximalist demands that are unlikely to be accepted by Kyiv, such as recognition of Russia's illegal annexation of Ukrainian regions and withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the parts of these regions remaining under Kyiv’s control.

Trump has expressed frustration with Russia's reluctance to make concessions and its intensifying and deadly attacks on Ukraine. He has so far refused to impose additional sanctions on Russia.

Ukrainian children are growing up in a world entirely reshaped by Russia’s war. Sirens, blackouts, and bomb shelters are nothing extraordinary — but a part of everyday childhood.

This photo story follows five families as they raise their children in the shadow of the ongoing invasion. It’s not about the battlefield, but of bedrooms with windows shattered by blasts, morning routines interrupted by air raid alerts, and games played in underground shelters. The war seeps into the smallest moments.

The Kyiv Independent spoke to children and their families to understand how war affects childhood, how it quietly rewrites dreams, creeps into fantasies, and redefines what it means to be safe. Children, in their honesty and imagination, reflect truths that adults sometimes struggle to express.

One thing all the children who spoke to the Kyiv Independent have in common: They all feel safest when there are no air raid alerts or the sounds of Russian missiles and drones above them.

Tina and Tymofii Tyshchenko

7 years old and 3 years old

The morning of Feb. 24, 2022, Tina and Tymofii’s mother Yuliia Tyshchenko woke up to feed then- 8-month-old Tymofii — when, for the first time, she heard the terrifying sound of the first explosions of the invasion. Within 10 minutes, Yuliia and her husband Bohdan Tyshchenko, had gathered their things, picked up their daughter Tina from her grandparents, and set off west, driving without a clear destination.

After the liberation of Kyiv Oblast, they returned home and now, they no longer want to leave. They are happy to be home.

They spent many nights hiding in the basement, but the children always got sick afterward. With no better option, they began taking shelter in their bathroom, even though they know it offers little real protection.

Every day, the family says they thank God and Ukraine’s defenders for the morning, for waking up, and for being alive.

Tina: The superpower of fire because it can destroy. I would first destroy (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, because he is very bad.

When I grow up, I’d buy, like, a gun or something, and I’d go and, um… pretend to be a Russian. And then I’d pick some poisonous berries — they don’t know what poisonous berries are. And then I’d give them some, and they’d all die and be dead.

I’d give Putin a worse death. And Russia too — a terrible one. Because Putin is very mean. And the president of Ukraine is much, much, much, much better.

The Kyiv Independent: You wouldn’t shoot him with fire, right?

Tina: No! I’d take care of him. And give him blueberries. Or strawberries.

The Kyiv Independent: You’d give blueberries or strawberries to our president?

Tina: Yes! Or cake.

Sofiia Ovsieienko

3 years old

Sofiia Ovsieienko was just five months old when Russia’s full-scale invasion began on Feb. 24, 2022. She and her mother, Kateryna Ovsieienko, fled Chernihiv under heavy shelling after spending three weeks in the city without electricity, water, or heating. They found temporary refuge in Germany, where they lived for six months before returning home.

Since returning, the war has shaped the rhythms of their daily life. After an explosion shattered their windows and a rocket fragment hit a neighboring apartment, going to the shelter during air raid alerts is a regular part of their routine. Sofiia knows what the sirens mean: time to run to the shelter. She does this at kindergarten, and she does it at home with her mom.

Sometimes, going to the shelter can even resemble a small adventure to Sofiia. She knows there will be other children there — and afterward, her mom always buys her cocoa or a hot dog.

The first thing she asks when they go underground is “What’s in the bag?” She knows her mom’s emergency backpack is always packed with her favorite toys and snacks.

The sound of knocking frightens her most.

When the war began, Matvii and his mother, Nina Logachova, left their home. His father stayed behind and joined the military. For six months, the mother and son lived with friends, first in Ukraine’s Carpathian Mountains, then in Portugal — before they returned.

Matvii is now in kindergarten. He loves robots and books. His favorite is “The Battle for the City,” a story that helps kids believe that light will overcome darkness and that evil will eventually be punished. He flips through the pages quickly, pausing to show the illustrations of war.

They still haven’t bought a mattress for the bathroom, where they hide during attacks. It’s hard to accept that this might be their reality for a long time. His mother’s calm helps, but she can’t silence the explosions that frighten Matvii so much.

When they travel abroad, Matvii remains tense, constantly asking his mother if the planes flying overhead are the “good ones.”

“Children are not made for war, fear, and despair in those little eyes. No children are,” Nina says.

On the first day of the full-scale invasion, the Davydenko family woke up to the sound of a missile whistling over their home in Kyiv. They immediately fled to western Ukraine.

Now they’re back home. Andrii often sleeps in his parents’ closet, surrounded by his favorite panda and capybara stuffed animals. During missile attacks, the family shelters there or in their building’s parking garage. When sheltering, they play games or discuss their hopes for the future.

Every month, Andrii helps underprivileged children from the NGO Misto Dobra, buying them gifts with his pocket money and going through his own toys and clothes to donate to the children.

Andrii: If I had a magic wish, the first would be for the war to end. The second would be 100 more wishes. The third: 200 more wishes. Or maybe… to have endless money. Because with money, you can do anything: end the war, buy whatever you want, and help other people.

The Kyiv Independent: How would you end the war with money?

At the beginning of the war, Timofii and his mother, Marharyta Valevach, left for Poland, while his father, Bohdan Moskalchuk, remained in Ukraine. Six months later, the family reunited and returned to Kyiv — because home is home, and everywhere else you’re a stranger.

War inevitably steals parts of childhood, and his parents are doing their best to lessen its impact. He won’t get another childhood.

Russia recruiting Ukrainians for illegal activities in Europe, Ukrainian intel warns

The Ukrainian and Russian delegations concluded peace talks in Istanbul on June 2, agreeing on a new prisoners of war (POWs) exchange but failing to reach a ceasefire.

The talks, hosted by Turkish officials, follow the first round of negotiations on May 16. The initial meeting ended with an agreement on the largest prisoner exchange of the war, but without any tangible progress toward a peace deal.

The parties agreed to conduct a major swap, which will include severely injured and young people aged 18 to 25.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the next prisoner exchange would feature at least 1,000 people on each side, and might reach a 1,200-for-1,200 swap that would possibly also include imprisoned journalists and political prisoners held in Russia.

After the talks, Russia pledged to transfer 6,000 bodies of fallen Ukrainian soldiers and officers to Ukraine and also proposed a ceasefire for two or three days in some areas of the front line in order to retrieve the bodies of the fallen soldiers.

Zelensky said that only 15% of the mentioned 6,000 are identified and that Ukraine would need to check that the bodies Russia is willing to return are those of Ukrainian soldiers.

""We had instances when they returned bodies that later were identified as their own,"" Zelensky said on June 2.

Following the talks, the Kyiv Independent obtained the text of the peace proposals that Ukraine, in turn, presented to Russia in Istanbul.

According to the document, the Ukrainian delegation offered Moscow a complete ceasefire, the exchange of prisoners of war in an ""all-for-all format,"" bringing back the children abducted by Russia, and the release of all civilians from Russian captivity.

Ukraine called for guarantees that would prevent Russia from repeating its aggression, as well as the involvement of the international community to achieve this.

According to Ukraine's proposal seen by the Kyiv Independent, Ukraine would continue on its path toward joining the EU and will become a member of NATO if there is consensus within the alliance.

Ukraine is also ready to agree to the gradual lifting of some sanctions against Russia, but with a mechanism for their renewal if necessary. Frozen Russian assets, in turn, should be used to rebuild Ukraine and pay reparations.

5 Ukrainian regions, ban on NATO, limits on Kyiv's army — Russian media publishes Moscow's official peace demands

The Russian delegation handed Ukraine a so-called ""peace memorandum"" with its proposals for a ceasefire during the second round of peace talks in Istanbul, Russian-state media outlet TASS reported on June 2, publishing the alleged document.

The Russian memorandum began circulating online following the talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, during which the parties again failed to reach a ceasefire.

Among Russia's key demands is the official recognition of Russia's annexation of Crimea, as well as the annexation of Ukraine's Kherson, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Luhansk oblasts, none of which Moscow controls in full.

Russia also demands the complete withdrawal of all troops from Kherson, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Luhansk oblasts, followed by demobilization in Ukraine.

Moscow's other demands include that Ukraine sticks to its neutral status, abandoning its aspirations to join NATO and other possible military alliances, a ban on the redeployment of Ukrainian troops, and a cessation of arms supplies and intelligence to Ukraine by its partners.

According to the document, Ukraine must abandon its claims for compensation for damages from the Russian war, guarantee amnesty for political prisoners, make Russian the official language, and not allow foreign troops to be deployed on its territory.

34% of Russian strategic Russian bombers at main airfields damaged in Ukrainian drone operation, SBU reports

The Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) reported that the June 1 ""Spiderweb"" drone operation caused approximately $7 billion in damages and disabled 34% of cruise missile bombers in key Russian airbases.

The agency confirmed that more details about the attack will be revealed later.

""We will strike them (Russia) at sea, in the air, and on the ground. And if needed, we'll get them from underground too,"" the SBU said in a message.

This operation targeted aircraft that is used in frequent long-range attacks on Ukrainian cities, and the plan had been in preparation for over a year and a half.

According to a Kyiv Independent SBU source, first-person-view (FPV) drones were covertly transported deep into Russian territory and hidden inside trucks before being launched against four major airfields.

The source said one of the airfields hit was the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk Oblast, more than 4,000 kilometers from Ukraine.

Olenya air base in Russia's Murmansk Oblast, the Diaghilev airbase in Ryazan Oblast, Ivanovo airbase in Ivanovo Oblast were also targeted.

More than 40 aircraft are known to have been hit, including the A-50, Tu-95, and Tu-22 M3, according to the source.

The Tu-95 is a Soviet-era plane that made its first flight in 1952. It was originally used to carry nuclear bombs but has since evolved to launch cruise missiles.

Each aircraft can carry 16 cruise missiles — either the Kh-55/Kh-555 or the newer Kh-101 and Kh-102 air-launched cruise missiles.

Russia has escalated its attacks against Ukraine in recent weeks, amid ongoing U.S.-backed ceasefire talks and negotiations.

On May 26, Russian forces launched the most extensive drone attack of the full-scale war, reportedly involving 355 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys.

Over 160 Ukrainian drones downed across Russia, Moscow claims day after mass strike on airfields

Russian air defenses intercepted 162 Ukrainian drones in a massive overnight attack across several regions, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed on June 2, with damage and explosions reported in multiple oblasts.

The reported attacks come as Ukraine ramped up its drone strikes inside Russian territory over the last few weeks, including a mass attack on Russian air bases a day earlier.

The new wave of drones targeted multiple cities and industrial facilities overnight on June 2, according to Russian Telegram channels. Explosions and air raid sirens were reported in at least six oblasts, including Voronezh, Kursk, Lipetsk, Ryazan, Ivanovo, and Volgograd.

The ministry claimed the drones were intercepted between the evening of June 1 and the early hours of June 2.

The largest number was reportedly downed over Kursk Oblast (57 drones), followed by the Belgorod (31), Lipetsk (27), Voronezh (16), Bryansk (11), Ryazan (11), Oryol (six), and Tambov (one) oblasts. Two drones were shot down over Russian-occupied Crimea, according to the ministry.

Ukraine has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified.

The attack follows a series of similar UAV raids in recent weeks targeting both military and industrial infrastructure inside Russia.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed to have hit 41 Russian heavy bombers at four airfields across the country on June 1 in one of the largest operations inside Russian territory.

Russia recruiting Ukrainians for illegal activities in Europe, Ukrainian intel warns

Russian intelligence services are actively attempting to recruit Ukrainian nationals for illegal operations across the European Union, Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) said on June 2.

In a statement, the agency warned that Kremlin-linked operatives are offering money to vulnerable Ukrainians, particularly those from Russian-occupied territories, to conduct surveillance of critical infrastructure and carry out other tasks for the benefit of the Russian state.

""The recruitment of Ukrainians for hostile operations in Europe is yet another tool of hybrid aggression that the Russian Federation is waging against Ukraine and the entire European community,"" the agency said.

The intelligence agency urged Ukrainian citizens abroad to immediately report any contact with suspicious individuals to local law enforcement or Ukrainian diplomatic missions.

The warning comes amid a growing number of suspected Russian-directed sabotage and arson plots across Europe involving Ukrainian nationals.

British security officials are currently investigating possible Russian involvement in a series of arson attacks targeting properties linked to U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the Financial Times reported on May 23. The incidents include fires at Starmer's family home, a vehicle, and a former residence in London earlier this month.

Three men — Ukrainian nationals Roman Lavrynovych and Petro Pochynok, and Romanian Stanislav Carpiuc — have been charged with conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life. Prosecutors allege they acted in coordination with unknown individuals, and U.K. authorities are examining whether Russian agents may have recruited them.

German authorities have also accused three Ukrainian nationals of being involved in a Russian-orchestrated parcel bomb plot, according to Der Spiegel. The suspects were arrested in May during coordinated raids in Germany and Switzerland.

In a separate case on May 12, Poland charged two Ukrainians in connection with suspected Russian-backed arson attacks at an IKEA store in Vilnius and a shopping mall in Warsaw in 2024.

Additionally, Russian intelligence is believed to be behind a July 2024 fire at a DHL airport logistics hub in Leipzig, Germany. Investigators said a flammable package sent from Lithuania was marked for delivery to a fake address in Birmingham, U.K.

Western officials have repeatedly accused Moscow of using covert sabotage, cyberattacks, and disinformation as part of its broader campaign to destabilize European nations that support Ukraine during the Russian large-scale war.

The Ukrainian intelligence agency emphasized that such operations rely on exploiting desperate individuals and weaponizing them against host countries. It called on European governments to remain vigilant and closely coordinate with Ukrainian security services.

President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized Russia’s proposal for a 2–3-day local ceasefire to retrieve the bodies of fallen soldiers, speaking during a June 2 online press conference attended by the Kyiv Independent.

Russia proposed a temporary two- to three-day ceasefire in specific areas of the front line to allow for the retrieval of fallen soldiers' bodies, Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky said on June 2. Medinsky, who heads Moscow’s delegation to the peace talks in Istanbul, made the statement during a press conference following the second round of negotiations with Ukraine.

""They just don’t see a ceasefire as such at the moment,"" Zelensky said of Russia's proposal. ""As they said regarding a ceasefire, they are ready for a 2–3-day ceasefire to retrieve the dead from the battlefield. I think they’re idiots, because, fundamentally, a ceasefire is meant so that there are no dead.""

""You can see their attitude. For them, this is just a brief pause in the war,"" the president added.

""That’s why we really want our American partners to push a sanctions package through the Senate with decisive steps — to pressure the Russians into a ceasefire with strong sanctions. They don’t understand any other way for now.""

U.S. President Donald Trump Trump said on May 28 that the U.S. would soon know whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is serious about ending the war. If not, he warned, Washington would ""respond a little bit differently.""

The U.S. president said he had not yet imposed new sanctions on Russia because he believed a peace deal might be within reach. ""If I think I'm close to getting a deal, I don't want to screw it up by doing that,"" he said, but added he is prepared to act if Moscow stalls further.

Ukraine's official proposal, obtained by the Kyiv Independent on June 2, suggests that some existing sanctions against Russia could be lifted in the event of a full ceasefire.

In a closely contested presidential runoff, conservative historian Karol Nawrocki has been declared the winner of Poland's 2025 presidential election, securing 50.89% of the vote against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski's 49.11%.

The result marks a significant shift in Polish politics, with consequences for both the domestic and international landscape — particularly in dealings with neighboring Ukraine, fighting off Russia's full-scale invasion.

Divided country

Late on June 1, Trzaskowski, his campaign staff, and members of Donald Tusk's ruling Civic Platform, which supported the Warsaw mayor, were celebrating.

Early exit polls showed Trzaskowski's slight lead. Together with earlier opinion polls that placed Trzaskowski ahead of his competition, it looked like his victory was a done deal.

Early on June 2, the official results were a cold shower for the liberal mayor. Nawrocki and the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party triumphed, retaining the presidency controlled by right-wing nationalists since 2015.

Though lacking any prior elected office, 42-years-old Nawrocki ran a campaign that resonated strongly with conservative voters by emphasizing traditional Catholic values, national sovereignty, and skepticism toward the European Union. His win, driven by promises of ""bringing back normalcy,"" is likely to slow — or even reverse — Poland's liberal political trajectory.

Law and Justice (PiS), led by Jarosław Kaczynski, was ousted from power in the 2023 parliamentary elections, losing control of the parliament for the first time since 2015. Following the Civic Platform's victory, many in the West celebrated Poland's liberal comeback.

But now, with support from nationalist and far-right voters rallying behind Slawomir Mentzen and Grzegorz Braun, PiS is in a position to hit back.

The Polish president holds limited executive power, but his veto power can paralyze the centrist agenda of the ruling coalition. Nawrocki pledged to use it to block many of Prime Minister Donald Tusk's reforms and key decisions.

The bitter campaign has left Poland bracing for further conflict.

Tusk and his allies played up allegations against Nawrocki, which he either denied or dismissed as political smears. These included accusations of exploiting an elderly man in a property deal, past involvement in football hooliganism, alleged ties to criminal circles and prostitution, and criticism for using nicotine pouches during live debates.

For many voters, Nawrocki's ""tough-guy persona"" — displayed in campaign videos of him at shooting ranges and boxing gyms — may have mattered more.

Uncertain Ukraine-Polish relations

Ukrainians have reacted to Nawrocki's victory with cautious concern.

President Volodymyr Zelensky was quick to congratulate him, expressing hope for ""continuing fruitful cooperation with Poland and personally with President Nawrocki.""

It's too early to say whether Poland's new president will bring significant change to Warsaw's relationship with Kyiv — but for now, there are few reasons for optimism.

With Poland hosting over a million Ukrainian refugees displaced by the war, Ukraine was one of the dominant topics throughout the campaign. Nawrocki drew criticism for stoking anxiety over Ukrainian refugees, echoing far-right concerns about migration, rising living costs, and security.

""For now, he definitely makes the impression of a Trumpist politician.""

His ""Poland first"" rhetoric included calls to prioritize Polish citizens in social services and adopt a more skeptical approach to continued aid for Ukrainians.

As president, Nawrocki will become commander-in-chief of the armed forces and play a key role in shaping foreign policy, especially toward countries to the east, where Polish presidents traditionally play a leading role.

Outgoing President Andrzej Duda, also from PiS, reinforced his legacy as one of Kyiv's strongest allies in the final days of his presidency. On May 30, he awarded Ukraine's military intelligence chiefs, Kyrylo Budanov and Vadym Skibitskyi, with Poland's highest state honors for their role in strengthening bilateral defense cooperation.

Nawrocki has declared support for Ukraine's sovereignty and resistance to Russian aggression. But his opposition to Ukraine's accession to NATO and the EU — citing unresolved historical grievances such as the Volhynian Massacre — has raised serious concerns in Kyiv.

Before his political rise, Nawrocki served as director of the Museum of the Second World War and head of the Institute of National Remembrance. His tenure at both institutions was defined by efforts to promote a patriotic historical narrative, including the removal of Soviet monuments — moves that landed him on Russia's wanted list, according to Polish media.

Unlike other Euroskeptic leaders in Central Europe, such as Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico or Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Nawrocki does not express pro-Russian views but he repeatedly accused Zelensky of taking advantage of allies.

His presidency is likely to open a more transactional phase in Polish-Ukrainian relations.

Seen by some as a ""Trumpian"" figure, Nawrocki met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House during the campaign and had Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem travel to Poland last week to back him.

Nawrocki's victory may also prove troublesome for the Polish government, which seeks to play an important role in a recently formed informal coalition of the U.K., Germany, France, and Poland aimed at counterbalancing Trump's policy on Ukraine.

""For now, he definitely makes the impression of a Trumpist politician,"" Zbigniew Parafianowicz, journalist and author of Polska na wojnie (Poland at War), told the Kyiv Independent.

""But the future depends on who ends up in his circle. If he is influenced by the people who shaped Duda's actions during the early stages of the war, things could look different.""

Mykola Kniazhytskyi, co-chair of the Ukrainian parliamentary group on relations with Poland, expressed hope that Nawrocki will maintain a pro-Ukrainian geopolitical outlook traditional for PiS — pointing to his advisor who recently visited Kyiv.

""I believe that people in Karol Nawrocki's circle, such as Professor (Andrzej) Nowak, will do everything to maintain the new president's support for our European integration processes,"" he said.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/GettyImages-2217453231.jpg

Ukraine aims to return up to 1,200 prisoners of war (POWs) in the next exchange with Russia following the second round of talks in Istanbul, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on June 2 during an online press conference attended by the Kyiv Independent.

Ukraine and Russia held direct talks in Turkey earlier in the day, agreeing on a new prisoner swap, which will reportedly include young people between the ages of 18 and 25, as well as people with serious injuries.

Zelensky said the next exchange is expected to be in a 1,000-for-1,000 format, with the possibility of increasing the number to 1,200 people on each side. The president added that future swap could also involve imprisoned journalists and political prisoners held in Russia.

""It is very important that the Russians allow the lists to be checked in advance, unlike last time,"" Zelensky said.

Ukraine and Russia held a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange from May 23 to 25 after previously agreeing to the exchange at peace talks on May 16. Aside from yielding a prisoner exchange, the peace negotiations in Istanbul were largely inconclusive.

Apart from Ukrainian prisoners of war, the exchange list also reportedly included Anatolii Taranenko, a Ukrainian service member accused of collaborating with Russia.

Taranenko's alleged inclusion in the exchange exacerbated criticism that Ukraine failed to secure the release of any Azov fighters and many civilians who had been held captive by Russia for years in what was the largest prisoner swap of the full-scale war.

Editor's note: This story has been updated with statements by Ukraine's Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and Russian President Vladimir Putin's advisor Vladimir Medinsky after the second round of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul.

Russia and Ukraine are preparing to hold a new prisoner of war (POW) exchange mediated by Turkey, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on June 2 at the Bucharest Nine (B9) summit.

The development comes after the second round of peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow in Istanbul on the same day.

Ukraine's Defense Minister and head of the Ukrainian delegation in Istanbul, Rustem Umerov, later confirmed that Russia and Ukraine had agreed to an exchange with priority given to seriously injured and younger soldiers, Suspilne reported.

Vladimir Medinsky, Russian President Vladimir Putin's aide and head of Russia's delegation to Istanbul, clarified that the exchange would apply to people under 25. The total number of people involved in the exchange could be as many as 1,000, he added.

As a result of the previous talks in Istanbul in May, Kyiv and Moscow carried out the largest prisoner swap during Russia's war in Ukraine, exchanging 1,000 people from each side.

""If Russia turns the Istanbul meetings into empty talk, new sanctions will have to be imposed not only by Europe but also at the level of the G7, including the U.S. and all those who want them,"" Zelensky said.

According to the president, sanctions should remain an important lever of influence on Russia, as it continues the war in Ukraine.

""Sanctions against Russia are necessary because they will significantly reduce tanker use and trade opportunities. Lower oil prices could hit the Russian economy. Without pressure, Putin will continue to manipulate everyone who wants to end the war,"" Zelensky added.

During the talks in Istanbul, the Ukrainian delegation presented a peace proposal expressing its readiness to make concessions regarding Russian sanctions if a full ceasefire is achieved. According to the proposal, some of the restrictions could be lifted gradually, provided that there is a mechanism for their renewal if necessary.

The Ukrainian proposal also includes a prisoner swap in an all-for-all format, bringing back Ukrainian children abducted by Russia, as well as the release of all civilians held in Russian captivity.

While ceasefire agreements and peace talks have remained elusive since the start of the full-scale invasion, regular prisoner swaps have remained one of the few areas of ongoing cooperation between the two countries.

Ukraine has long advocated for an ""all-for-all"" exchange, but Russia has so far rejected the proposal.

At least 8,000 Ukrainian service members are held captive by Russia, Iryna Vereshchuk, president's office deputy head, said on May 1, citing data from Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of POWs.

Russia has proposed to Ukraine a temporary ceasefire for two or three days in certain areas of the front line to collect the bodies of the fallen soldiers, Vladimir Medinsky, Russian President Vladimir Putin's aide and head of the country's delegation to Istanbul, said during a press conference on June 2.

Medinsky's statement comes hours after the conclusion of the second round of the peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul.

Ukraine has not yet reacted to the Russian proposal. According to a source in the President's Office, who spoke on condition of anonymity, Russia declined a ceasefire proposed by Ukraine.

According to Medinsky, Russia will also transfer 6,000 bodies of Ukrainian soldiers and officers.

""We identified all (the bodies) that we could, conducted DNA tests, found out who they were. Next week, we will transfer these bodies to the Ukrainian side in an organized way by special trains so that they can bury them humanely,"" Medinsky said.

Medinsky added that Ukraine and Russia also agreed to exchange severely wounded people and those under 25. The total number of people involved in the exchange could reach 1,000, he added.

A representative of the Russian delegation also showed a list handed over by Ukraine during the talks. The list included 339 names of children abducted by Russia and whom Ukraine wants to return to their homes.

Medinsky denied Kyiv's accusations, claiming that Russia did not abduct the children.

Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has identified over 19,500 children who were forcibly deported to Russia, Belarus, or Russian-occupied territories. To date, only around 1,300 have been returned to Ukrainian-controlled areas, according to official data.

The abduction of Ukrainian children has drawn international condemnation. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Children's Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, accusing them of overseeing the forced deportations.

Earlier this month, the European Parliament passed a resolution labeling Russia's actions a ""genocidal strategy"" aimed at erasing Ukrainian identity, and demanded the unconditional return of all abducted minors.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2214590893.jpg

Some of the sanctions against Russia could be lifted following a potential full ceasefire, according to Ukraine's official proposal, seen by the Kyiv Independent on June 2.

Yet, the condition proposed by Ukraine is that sanctions are automatically renewed if the ceasefire agreement is broken.

Russia and Ukraine held a second round of talks in Istanbul on June 2. Kyiv presented a peace proposal that included potential easing of restrictions on Moscow, among other clauses.

During the talks in Istanbul, the Ukrainian delegation offered Moscow a complete ceasefire, an all-for-all exchange of prisoners of war (POWs), the return of children abducted by Russia, and the release of all civilians from Russian captivity.

According to the proposal, Ukraine retains its aspirations to join the EU and NATO. Kyiv also highlighted the need for security guarantees to avoid another Russian invasion.

In the meantime, frozen Russian assets must be used to rebuild Ukraine and pay reparations, the proposal seen by the Kyiv Independent read.

Contrary, the head of the Russian delegation said that a ceasefire is possible only following Ukraine's withdrawal from four of the country's regions — Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson — none of which Russia controls in full.

The West has imposed heavy sanctions on Russia since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in 2022. In spite of these measures, Moscow retains its ability to wage war, gradually advancing in several sectors of the front line and increasing its defense production.



U.S. President Donald Trump's stance on U.S. sanctions against Russia has been unclear. Trump has repeatedly threatened additional economic measures against Moscow but said he does not plan to take the step at the moment after his phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

A bipartisan group of U.S. senators has said they are ready to vote on a bill on sanctions against Russia if peace talks over the war in Ukraine do not progress soon. The bill, introduced to the Senate in early April, would impose new penalties on Russia and slap 500% tariffs on imports from countries that buy Russian oil, petroleum products, natural gas, or uranium.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/GettyImages-2217651149.jpg

The family of late Andriy Portnov, a former top aide to ex-President Viktor Yanukovych, acquired more than $2 million worth of real estate in Dubai during Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, an investigative report by Schemes, a project by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, has revealed on June 2.

According to property records leaked from Dubai's Land Department and state-owned utilities, verified in collaboration with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and Le Monde, six properties were purchased in 2022–2023 by Portnov's civil partner, Anastasiia Valiaieva, and his daughter, Liliia Portnova. As of mid-2025, five of the properties remain under their ownership.

The first known purchase was made by Portnova in October 2022, when she bought a 69-square-meter apartment in Sobha Hartland One Park Avenue for around $320,000.

Property acquisitions reportedly accelerated in mid-2023, with Portnova and Valiaieva investing in multiple new developments, including Sobha Hartland Waves Opulence and Creek Vista Heights, spending between $132,000 and $600,000 per unit.

One property — an apartment in Sobha Hartland Waves Opulence valued at over $600,000 — is still under construction and slated for completion in September 2025. Another, in Creek Vista Heights, worth more than $550,000, is expected to be completed in 2026.

Despite owning these high-end assets, Schemes found no public records indicating current business activity for either woman. Valiaieva previously owned a company called Vasilisa Group, formerly known as Portnov Group and linked to Portnov himself, but he ceased to be listed as its owner in 2020.

Journalists were also able to confirm that Valiaieva has held Russian citizenship since 2014 and that Portnova is a Swiss national.

In April 2024, Portnov transferred ownership of a luxury estate outside Kyiv to his children through a notarized deed of gift. The document, obtained by Schemes, shows that the transaction was conducted by Valiaieva on behalf of their children.

A Ukrainian notary certified the deed, while a lawyer who previously represented Portnov in court, Marina Parinova, acted on his behalf using a power of attorney notarized in Madrid.

Neither Portnova nor Valiaieva responded to requests for comment from Schemes, nor did attorneys previously associated with Portnov.

The revelations come around two weeks after Portnov was shot dead in Madrid on May 21.

Ukrainian military intelligence confirmed his death to the Kyiv Independent. Spanish media outlets said Portnov was shot at five times, with at least three bullets striking his head and torso. No arrests have been made.

Portnov, 51, was a central figure in the Yanukovych administration from 2010 to 2014 and was sanctioned by the United States in 2021 over allegations of corruption and judicial manipulation. After fleeing Ukraine following the 2014 EuroMaidan Revolution, he resided in Russia and Austria, returning to Ukraine in 2019. He fled again in June 2022 after Russia's full-scale invasion began.

Known as one of the most litigious ex-officials in Ukraine, Portnov sued several media outlets, including the Kyiv Independent, over reports labeling him ""pro-Russian."" He won a defamation case in a Kyiv court in 2024.

His influence extended into the media as well: he briefly headed the pro-Russian TV channel NewsOne in 2018. A 2020 UkraineWorld report accused Portnov of using online bots to discredit the EuroMaidan Revolution and Ukraine's pro-European reforms.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-26-at-18_08_32-1.png

Russian drone attacks against a State Emergency Service building in Zaporizhzhia Oblast's front-line areas on June 2 injured 12 emergency workers, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported.

Russian first-person-view (FPV) drones struck the building and service vehicles in the Stepnohirsk community, according to the governor.

Russian forces attacked again during an evacuation of the injured, the State Emergency Service reported. Russia has repeatedly employed double-tap attacks against civilian targets, often resulting in casualties among first responders.

All of the victims have been hospitalized. One of them is in a critical state, while others have suffered injuries of moderate severity.

Stepnohirsk lies only some 5 kilometers (3 miles) north of the front line in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The emergency workers were injured despite being in the shelter during the attack, the State Emergency Service said.

Fire trucks also suffered damage as a result of a direct hit.

Ukraine’s Armed Forces responded to recent comments by Andrii Biletskyi, commander of the 3rd Army Corps, who claimed that the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade had not received any state-supplied (first-person-view) FPV drones for three months, Babel reported on June 2.

The 3rd Brigade, which formed the basis for the formation of the 3rd Army Corps, is seen as one of the most battle-hardened Ukrainian units. Many of its members include Azov veterans.

In a written response to a request from Babel, the Armed Forces of Ukraine said the brigade had received a total of 7,992 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of various types between Jan. 1 and May 27. The military did not clarify whether that number included FPV drones.

According to the military's logistics service, units are provided with a list of available equipment and may select what they need. All requests submitted by the 3rd Assault Brigade were reportedly fulfilled.

The brigade must submit a separate request to the Defense Ministry for targeted funding if it requires a specific modification that is not in stock, the response read.

That was the case in May, when the 3rd Assault Brigade received funds for procurement, the logistics department told Babel. In total, the state reportedly allocated Hr 151.5 million (about $3.6 million) to the brigade in 2025 for drone purchases. As of May 28, 57% of those funds had been spent.

Biletskyi made his comments in an interview published May 11 with journalist Yurii Butusov.

""I'd like to 'thank' the Defense Ministry — for three months, the 3rd Assault Brigade did not receive a single FPV drone,"" Biletskyi said.

""We were severely lacking (the drones,) "" he added. ""Without the FPVs supplied by the state, we really dried out during these three months, because the front line is huge.""

Biletskyi also said the supply flow of drones to his unit has fluctuated. ""In some periods, we received 30–40% of what was needed, and that mattered.""

Drones have proven especially effective during Ukraine's full-scale war with Russia, with both sides using them extensively on the front lines and for strikes beyond the battlefield.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2152788960.jpg

Elvira Nabiullina, the governor of the Russian central bank, is facing government pressure to reduce the high key interest rate imposed amid skyrocketing wartime inflation, Bloomberg reported on June 2, citing undisclosed sources.

The reason is the growing toll on the federal budget and civilian industries, three officials told Bloomberg, with some calling for the decision to be made at the bank's meeting on June 6.

Russia's central bank imposed a 21% key interest rate in October 2024 — the highest level since the early 2000s — to tackle surging inflation, which has dropped to 6.2% this April from 10.7% in January, according to Russian official data.

The high borrowing costs primarily impacted civilian industries unrelated to the Russian military-industrial complex, which has experienced growth amid Russia's record wartime spending, Bloomberg reported.

Nabiullina was seen as a key figure in helping the Russian economy stay afloat as the West imposed massive sanctions due to Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The bank governor has nevertheless faced backlash over her decision on borrowing costs. In January, Russian President Vladimir Putin voiced displeasure with the decline in private investment due to the high cost of credit.

After some positive signals earlier in 2025 due to U.S. President Donald Trump's outreach to Moscow and hopes for a ceasefire, more recent reports again indicate a sharp slowdown in Russia's economic growth.

U.S. President Donald Trump was not informed in advance about Ukraine's mass drone attack that allegedly hit 41 Russian aircraft across four air bases, CBS News and Axios reported on June 1, citing their undisclosed sources.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) operation, dubbed ""Spiderweb,"" allegedly destroyed or damaged A-50, Tu-95, and Tu-22 M3 planes parked at the Belaya, Diaghilev, Olenya, and Ivanovo air bases on June 1.

Kyiv has claimed it had disabled 34% of Russia's strategic bomber fleet in what is seen as one of the most daring operations during the full-scale war. The strike reportedly involved 117 drones launched from trucks hidden across Russian territory.

The White House was not notified about the plans, which had been being prepared for a year and a half, Axios reported, citing a Ukrainian security official. CBS News' sources in the Trump administration also confirmed that the Trump administration was not informed.

CNN reported on June 2 that U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ""received regular updates"" about Ukraine's operation as he traveled to Joint Base Andrews on Sunday but has not yet talked to his Ukrainian counterparts.

Trump is yet to comment publicly on the attack, which took place a day before the second round of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul.

The U.S. president has repeatedly criticized Moscow for launching attacks on Ukrainian cities as he pushes for a ceasefire deal. The Kremlin continues to reject the truce backed by Kyiv, Washington, and European partners, and is reportedly preparing a new offensive this summer.

Trump has also often criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky, claiming that Ukraine is at times ""more difficult"" to deal with than Russia. The two came into an open clash during a tense meeting in the White House on Feb. 28.

Zelensky has urged the U.S. president to impose stronger sanctions against Russia if the upcoming round of negotiations fails to bring results.

""If the Istanbul meeting brings nothing, that clearly means strong new sanctions are urgently needed — from the EU's 18th package, and from the United States specifically, the strongest sanctions President Trump promised,"" Zelensky said.

Trump said on May 28 that the U.S. would soon know whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is serious about ending the war. If not, he warned, Washington would ""respond a little bit differently.""

The U.S. president said he had not yet imposed new sanctions on Russia because he believed a peace deal might be within reach.

President Volodymyr Zelensky on June 2 called on U.S. President Donald Trump to deliver a ""strong new package"" of sanctions against Russia if ongoing peace talks in Istanbul fail to bring results.

Speaking at a joint summit of the Bucharest Nine and Nordic leaders in Vilnius, Zelensky warned that if Moscow derails the negotiations, the West must be ready to act decisively.

""If the Istanbul meeting brings nothing, that clearly means strong new sanctions are urgently needed — from the EU's 18th package, and from the United States specifically, the strongest sanctions President Trump promised,"" Zelensky said.

""Sanctions should hit Russian energy — especially oil and tankers — price caps, of course, and also Russian banks and the financial sector overall.""

Trump said on May 28 that the U.S. would soon know whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is serious about ending the war. If not, he warned, Washington would ""respond a little bit differently.""

Ukrainian and Russian delegations prepare to meet in Istanbul on June 2 for a new round of peace talks. Though previous talks ended with the biggest prisoner exchange, they failed to produce progress toward a ceasefire or peace deal.

The Ukrainian side is expected to present a step-by-step peace proposal, starting with a 30-day ceasefire and the return of children deported to Russian-controlled areas. Russia has not submitted any formal memorandum ahead of the meeting and continues to demand a halt to Western military support for Kyiv — conditions that Ukraine deems unacceptable.

Zelensky made clear that Kyiv still aims to ""achieve at least some progress,"" despite Russian foot-dragging and intensifying airstrikes. He also expressed gratitude to leaders working to keep the transatlantic alliance strong.

""We need the support of President Trump, the U.S. Congress, and the American people,"" he said. ""Whatever happens in global competition, it is our shared duty — Europe's, America's, and everyone who values freedom — to defend it together.""

The summit also focused on regional security ahead of the NATO summit this June. Zelensky emphasized that Russia must not be allowed to influence NATO's decisions or have any veto power over its enlargement — a rebuke to recent reports suggesting Moscow is seeking written guarantees that the alliance will stop expanding.

""One of the key principles of European security is that Russia must not have veto power over NATO decisions or influence over the allies or its members,"" Zelensky said. ""That principle must remain in place.""

While Russian officials continue to push for NATO to ""stop"" its expansion, most recently as a precondition for the ceasefire, alliance diplomats told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that no such discussions are taking place within NATO.

Zelensky said the upcoming NATO summit must deliver a message of strength and unity.

""Putin chose to stand against Europe, so he has no place in deciding its future,"" he said. ""That must not change.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/d409c9033c62c514a9df2fbd0b94ad5e_1748862216_extra_large.jpeg

The Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) reported that the June 1 “Spiderweb” drone operation caused approximately $7 billion in damages and disabled 34% of cruise missile bombers in key Russian airbases.

The agency confirmed that more details about the attack will be revealed later.

“And you thought Ukraine was easy? Ukraine is exceptional. Ukraine is unique. All the steamrollers of history have rolled over it. It has withstood every kind of trial. It is tempered by the highest degree. In today’s world, its value is beyond measure,” the SBU wrote, quoting Ukrainian poet Lina Kostenko.

They also vowed to continue to drive Russian forces out of Ukrainian territory.

“We will strike them (Russia) at sea, in the air, and on the ground. And if needed, we’ll get them from underground too,” the SBU said.

This operation targeted aircraft that is used in frequent long-range attacks on Ukrainian cities, and the plan had been in preparation for over a year and a half.

According to a Kyiv Independent SBU source, first-person-view (FPV) drones were covertly transported deep into Russian territory and hidden inside trucks before being launched against four major airfields.

The source said one of the airfields hit was the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk Oblast, more than 4,000 kilometers from Ukraine.

Olenya air base in Russia's Murmansk Oblast, the Diaghilev airbase in Ryazan Oblast, Ivanovo airbase in Ivanovo Oblast were also targeted.

More than 40 aircraft are known to have been hit, including the A-50, Tu-95, and Tu-22 M3, according to the source.

The Tu-95 is a Soviet-era plane that made its first flight in 1952. It was originally used to carry nuclear bombs but has since evolved to launch cruise missiles.

Each aircraft can carry 16 cruise missiles – either the Kh-55/Kh-555 or the newer Kh-101 and Kh-102 air-launched cruise missiles.

Russia has escalated its attacks against Ukraine in recent weeks, amid ongoing U.S.-backed ceasefire talks and negotiations.

Russian authorities are weighing whether to reward residents who tried to stop Ukrainian drones by throwing stones at them during a mass drone strike on Russian air bases, Governor of Russia's Irkutsk Oblast Igor Kobzev said on June 2.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has claimed responsibility for the coordinated strike, which it says hit 41 Russian military aircraft across four strategic airfields, including Belaya in Irkutsk Oblast, thousands of kilometers from the Ukrainian border.

""In the operational staff, we will evaluate the actions of concerned citizens who tried to interfere with the work of drones and decide on their recognition,"" Kobzev wrote on Telegram, praising locals for what he called their ""non-indifference.""

The SBU later claimed that the strike caused $7 billion in damage and disabled 34% of Russia's cruise missile carrier fleet.

Editor's Note: This story has been updated with the latest election results and President Volodymyr Zelensky's reaction.

Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing nationalist supported by the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, has won Poland's presidential election.

Nawrocki garnered 50.89% of the vote in the run-off election on June 1, narrowly defeating his liberal rival, Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, according to Poland's National Election Commission. Trzaskowski earned 49.11% of the votes.

The closely-watched election has been widely seen as an inflection point in Poland's political trajectory, including its approach to Polish-Ukrainian relations. Nawrocki, known for adopting a ""Trumpian"" style of politics, has been criticized for parroting pro-Russian narratives due to his opposition to Ukraine's NATO membership.

Earlier in the night, Poland's elections were deemed too close to call, with exit polls showing showing Trzaskowski and Nawrocki virtually tied. Early polls showed Trzaskowski with a narrow lead, while more recent polls flipped the results in Nawrocki's favor.



Trzaskowski, whose campaign hinged on supporting Prime Minister Donald Tusk's democratic reforms, was the first to declare victory after an initial exit poll suggested he would secure a narrow win.

An exit poll by Ipsos for the broadcaster Polsat showed Trzaskowski, of the ruling centrist Civic Coalition (KO) party, winning by a slim margin of 50.3%.

""We won,"" Trzaskowski told party members after the first exit poll results came out. ""I will bring people together, I will be constructive, I will be a president for all Poles. I will be your president.""

However, a later poll flipped the results, showing Nawrocki narrowly ahead with 50.7%. Speaking to his supporters, Nawrocki also declared victory.

""Congratulations to (Karol Nawrocki) on winning the presidential election,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said on June 2 after full results were announced.

""Poland, which preserves the strength of its national spirit and its faith in justice, has been and remains a pillar of regional and European security, and a strong voice defending freedom and dignity for every nation.""

While Poland has a parliamentary system in which the president's authority is largely ceremonial, the Polish president is still able to veto legislation proposed by the parliament.

Moreover, the president plays a key role in foreign affairs and serves as commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Polish presidents have historically been particularly active in shaping eastern policy.

While both candidates agreed on certain issues — such as increasing defense spending and supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia's full-scale invasion — they diverged on Ukraine's potential NATO accession.

Trzaskowski supported Ukraine joining NATO, whereas Nawrocki has signed an eight-point declaration that included a pledge to block Kyiv's membership in the alliance.

Although Trzaskowski has been seen as more ""pro-Ukrainian,"" both presidential candidates have taken positions targeting Ukrainian refugees. Russian disinformation campaigns also targeted the election, particularly amplifying anti-Ukrainian sentiment in Poland.

The candidates also disagreed on several key social issues, highlighting deep divides in Polish politics and society more broadly.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/GettyImages-2217555009.jpg

The first satellite images have emerged showing the aftermath of a major Ukrainian drone strike on Russia's Belaya air base in Irkutsk Oblast, revealing significant damage to Moscow's fleet of strategic bombers, geospatial intelligence consultant Chris Biggers posted on X on June 2.



The strike was part of a coordinated operation by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) targeting multiple Russian military airfields.

The photos, captured by U.S. aerospace company Umbra Space, appear to confirm the destruction of at least three Tu-95MS strategic bombers and one Tu-22M3 aircraft, with an additional Tu-95MS visibly damaged. Another image shows two more likely destroyed Tu-22M3 bombers on the field.

The SBU carried out the massive drone attack on June 1, which reportedly hit 41 Russian aircraft across four different airfields.

Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council official Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation, said at least 13 Russian aircraft were destroyed in the attack, with more damaged. The claims could not be independently verified.

According to a source in the SBU who spoke to the Kyiv Independent, the operation — codenamed ""Spiderweb"" — involved smuggling first-person-view (FPV) drones deep into Russian territory. The drones were hidden in mobile wooden cabins on trucks and remotely launched at the right moment to strike bombers used in missile attacks on Ukrainian cities.

The Belaya air base, over 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) from Ukraine, was among the most distant targets. Other bases included the Olenya (Murmansk Oblast), Diaghilev (Ryazan Oblast), and Ivanovo (Ivanovo Oblast) air bases.

The SBU said the strikes disabled 34% of Russia's cruise missile bombers and inflicted approximately $7 billion in damage.

Russia's Defense Ministry later admitted to a ""terrorist attack"" on the four air bases, saying ""several units of aircraft caught fire.""

The scale and reach of the operation, enabled by low-cost FPV drones, underscore Ukraine's growing long-range strike capabilities, especially against aircraft that have long launched missile barrages from deep inside Russian territory.

SBU Chief Vasyl Maliuk and President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly oversaw the long-planned operation.

On the evening of June 1, Zelensky described the operation as ""brilliant,"" adding that Russia suffered ""significant losses — entirely justified and deserved.""

""What’s most interesting, and this can now be stated publicly, is that the 'office' of our operation on Russian territory was located directly next to FSB headquarters in one of their regions,"" he said in a post on social media.

""In total, 117 drones were used in the operation with a corresponding number of drone operators involved,"" he added.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/June-1-SBU.png

Russian intelligence services are actively attempting to recruit Ukrainian nationals for illegal operations across the European Union, Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) said on June 2.

In a statement, the agency warned that Kremlin-linked operatives are offering money to vulnerable Ukrainians, particularly those from Russian-occupied territories, to conduct surveillance of critical infrastructure and carry out other tasks for the benefit of the Russian state.

""The recruitment of Ukrainians for hostile operations in Europe is yet another tool of hybrid aggression that the Russian Federation is waging against Ukraine and the entire European community,"" the agency said.

The intelligence agency urged Ukrainian citizens abroad to immediately report any contact with suspicious individuals to local law enforcement or Ukrainian diplomatic missions.

The warning comes amid a growing number of suspected Russian-directed sabotage and arson plots across Europe involving Ukrainian nationals.

British security officials are currently investigating possible Russian involvement in a series of arson attacks targeting properties linked to U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the Financial Times reported on May 23. The incidents include fires at Starmer's family home, a vehicle, and a former residence in London earlier this month.

Three men — Ukrainian nationals Roman Lavrynovych and Petro Pochynok, and Romanian Stanislav Carpiuc — have been charged with conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life. Prosecutors allege they acted in coordination with unknown individuals, and U.K. authorities are examining whether Russian agents may have recruited them.

German authorities have also accused three Ukrainian nationals of being involved in a Russian-orchestrated parcel bomb plot, according to Der Spiegel. The suspects were arrested in May during coordinated raids in Germany and Switzerland.

In a separate case on May 12, Poland charged two Ukrainians in connection with suspected Russian-backed arson attacks at an IKEA store in Vilnius and a shopping mall in Warsaw in 2024.

Additionally, Russian intelligence is believed to be behind a July 2024 fire at a DHL airport logistics hub in Leipzig, Germany. Investigators said a flammable package sent from Lithuania was marked for delivery to a fake address in Birmingham, U.K.

Western officials have repeatedly accused Moscow of using covert sabotage, cyberattacks, and disinformation as part of its broader campaign to destabilize European nations that support Ukraine during the Russian large-scale war.

The Ukrainian intelligence agency emphasized that such operations rely on exploiting desperate individuals and weaponizing them against host countries. It called on European governments to remain vigilant and closely coordinate with Ukrainian security services.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1259010576.jpg

Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least nine civilians and injured at least 49, including children, over the past day, regional authorities reported on June 2.

The attacks come as Ukrainian and Russian officials are scheduled to hold a second round of peace talks in Istanbul later during the day. They also follow a mass Ukrainian drone strike that allegedly destroyed or damaged one-third of Russia's strategic aviation fleet on June 2.

Russia attacked Ukraine with 80 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys, as well as three Iskander-M or KN-23 ballistic missiles and one Iskander-K cruise missile, the Air Force reported.

Ukrainian air defenses shot down 15 drones, while 37 were intercepted by electronic warfare systems or disappeared from radars, according to the statement.

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian artillery and drone attacks against the Nikopol district injured three men aged 51, 68, and 72, all of whom were hospitalized, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. A medical facility, a fire department, and a shop were reportedly damaged.

Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast killed one person and injured three in Kostiantynivka, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. Another civilian was injured by a Russian strike in Hryshyne.

Russia attacked Kharkiv Oblast heavily with drones, a ballistic missile, and other weaponry. Twelve people, including two children, were injured in the region, including six in Kharkiv, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said.

Editor's note: The story is being updated.

Russian air defenses intercepted 162 Ukrainian drones in a massive overnight attack across several regions, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed on June 2, with damage and explosions reported in multiple oblasts.

The reported attacks come as Ukraine ramped up its drone strikes inside Russian territory over the last few weeks, including a mass attack on Russian air bases a day earlier.

The new wave of drones targeted multiple cities and industrial facilities overnight on June 2, according to Russian Telegram channels. Explosions and air raid sirens were reported in at least six oblasts, including Voronezh, Kursk, Lipetsk, Ryazan, Ivanovo, and Volgograd.

The ministry claimed the drones were intercepted between the evening of June 1 and the early hours of June 2.

The largest number was reportedly downed over Kursk Oblast (57 drones), followed by the Belgorod (31), Lipetsk (27), Voronezh (16), Bryansk (11), Ryazan (11), Oryol (six), and Tambov (one) oblasts. Two drones were shot down over Russian-occupied Crimea, according to the ministry.

In Voronezh, a series of loud explosions occurred around 11 p.m. local time on June 1, shaking windows and triggering car alarms. More than 15 drones were reportedly downed over the city, with bright flashes visible in the night sky.

Around 11:40 p.m., drones reportedly struck the city of Kursk. Debris from a downed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) reportedly hit the upper floors of a nine-story apartment building, damaging at least two units. Two houses and several vehicles were also affected. No injuries were reported.

In Lipetsk Oblast, drones reportedly attacked the city of Lipetsk and nearby towns, with some claims suggesting a possible attempt to strike the Novolipetsk Steel plant. Bright flashes were seen over the city. NLMK is Russia's largest steel mill, producing about 20% of the country's steel output.

Ukraine reportedly targeted the plant in February as well.

Ryazan Oblast also came under attack, with falling debris reportedly damaging parked cars and breaking windows in several residential buildings.

Additional drone activity was reported near Voronezh, where several UAVs were reportedly intercepted on approach. Air raid alerts were also issued in the Ivanovo and Volgograd oblasts.

Ukraine has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified.

The attack follows a series of similar UAV raids in recent weeks targeting both military and industrial infrastructure inside Russia.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Russia attacked the city of Kharkiv overnight with drones and ballistic missiles, injuring at least six people, including a child, local authorities reported in the early hours of June 2.

Drone strikes on the city's Kholodnohirskyi district injured six people, including a 7-year-old boy, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported.

Two Russian ballistic missiles also targeted the Kyivskyi district, Terekhov said. One of the missiles struck a road ""just a few dozen meters"" from a local school. The other hit an area close to high-rise buildings, shattering windows and damaging facades.

""It is a miracle that there were no casualties,"" Terekhov said.

Several homes, a civilian enterprise, and vehicles were damaged in the attack, according to Terekhov.

Earlier in the day, President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Russia may be preparing for another mass strike against Ukraine in the wake of Kyiv's successful operation against Russian military aircraft.

""Even before the start of this operation, we had intelligence about the preparation of another Russian massive strike,"" Zelensky said in his evening address.

""And it is very important for all our people not to ignore aerial alerts. Last night, there were almost 500 Russian drones, strike drones. Every week they increased the number of units per strike. Now they have also prepared Kalibr cruise missles from sea carriers.""

Russia has launched repeated large-scale aerial assaults against Ukraine in recent days.

The city of Kharkiv and the surrounding region came under heavy attack the previous night during a mass Russian drone strike. Russia launched nearly 500 drones at Ukraine, shattering its previous record for the number of drones fired in a single night.

Russia launched a record number of drones at Ukraine in a mass overnight aerial attack, Ukraine's Air Force reported the morning of June 1.

Russia attacked Ukraine during the night with 472 Shahed-type attack drones, breaking its previous record — set just last week on May 26 — by over 100 drones.

In addition to nearly 500 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), Moscow also targeted Ukraine with three Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles and four Kh-101, Iskander-K air and ground-based cruise missiles, the Air Force said.

Ukrainian air defense units shot down 210 drones, while another 172 were suppressed by electronic warfare, according to the Air Force. Russian drones were intercepted in 18 different locations across the country.

The record-shattering drone attack came on the eve of Ukraine's ""Operation Spider Web"" — a major strike on Russia's military airfields coordinated by Ukraine's Security Service (SBU). The operation hit 41 Russian bombers at four airfields, according to the SBU.

The attack, planned for over a year, involved smuggling first-person-view (FPV) drones deep into Russia. The operation caused approximately $7 billion in damages and disabled 34% of cruise missile carriers in key Russian air bases, the SBU reported.

Ukraine's strike on Russia's military aircraft follows some of Moscow's heaviest aerial bombardments since the beginning of the full-scale war.

For three nights in a row from May 24-26, Russia barraged Ukraine with drones and missiles, launching a record 298 drones on May 25 only to break the record with 355 the following night.

The escalating attacks form the backdrop against which Ukrainian and Russian delegations prepare for their second round of direct peace talks, scheduled for June 2 in Istanbul. The Kremlin has claimed it will submit a memorandum outlining its ceasefire conditions during the meeting — though previous promises to present terms have been followed by weeks of delays.

The first round of talks, held May 16, failed to produce any significant breakthroughs towards a peace settlement.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held a phone call on June 1 to discuss Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and upcoming peace talks scheduled for June 2 in Istanbul.

The call comes on the eve of the second round of direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow, amid escalating attacks as the Kremlin continues to reject calls for an unconditional ceasefire.

According to Russia's Foreign Ministry, Lavrov and Rubio ""exchanged views on various initiatives concerning a settlement of the Ukraine crisis, including plans to resume direct Russian-Ukrainian talks in Istanbul on June 2.""

The State Department confirmed that Russia requested the call and that Rubio reiterated U.S. President Donald Trump's call for direct talks between Russia and Ukraine to achieve ""a lasting peace.""

During the most recent peace talks on May 16 — the first direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine since the start of the war — the two parties spoke for less than two hours, with no agreement reached on a ceasefire.

Moreover, Moscow reiterated its maximalist demands for Kyiv to withdraw completely from four Ukrainian oblasts, despite Russia not controlling any of them in their entirety.

Although the peace talks were largely unsuccessful, Russia and Ukraine managed to reach an agreement for the exchange of prisoners of war (POWs) on a 1,000-for-1,000 basis.

More than a week ago, Russia also promised to reveal its peace terms after the prisoner exchange, but has yet to deliver.

During the June 1 phone call, the Russian Foreign Ministry claimed that Rubio also expressed his condolences over the deaths that resulted from recent train derailment in Russia's Bryansk Oblast, which borders Ukraine.

Zelensky announces updated Ukrainian delegation list for upcoming peace talks with Russia

An operation by Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) using first-person-view (FPV) drones smuggled deep inside Russian and hidden inside trucks has hit 41 Russian heavy bombers at four airfields across the country, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent on June 1.

The operation — codenamed ""Spider Web"" – was planned for more than a year and a half and has dealt a major blow to Moscow's ability to attack Ukrainian cities.

According to the SBU, the drone operation resulted in $7 billion in damages and disabled 34% of cruise missile bombers in key Russian air bases.

""The SBU first transported FPV drones to Russia, and later, on the territory of the Russian Federation, the drones were hidden under the roofs of mobile wooden cabins, already placed on trucks,"" the source said.

""At the right moment, the roofs of the cabins were opened remotely, and the drones flew to hit Russian bombers.""

The operation targeted multiple Russian air bases, including Belaya in Irkutsk, Olenya in Murmansk, Diaghilev in Ryazan, and Ivanovo in Ivanovo Oblast.

""Currently, more than 40 aircraft are known to have been hit, including the A-50, Tu-95 and Tu-22 M3,"" the source added.

President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the results of the drone operation, calling it ""absolutely brilliant.""

Ukrainian intelligence promised to reveal more details soon and vowed to continue driving Russian forces out of Ukrainian territory.

""We will strike (Russia) at sea, in the air, and on the ground. And if needed, we'll get them from underground too,"" the SBU said.

Russian soldiers surrendered because 'abuse in units is worse than captivity,' Ukrainian paratroopers say

A group of Russian soldiers fighting in the Kursk direction surrendered to Ukrainian paratroopers because ""abuse in units is worse than captivity,"" Ukraine's Airborne Assault Forces said in a video posted on social media on May 31.

""In their units on the territory of the Russian Federation, they were subjected to inhumane treatment, psychological pressure and threats,"" the post reads.

Russia's abuse of its own soldiers has been well documented throughout the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

An investigation by the Insider last July reported that Russia uses a systematic program of ""gulag-style"" abuse directed at its soldiers in Ukraine in order to ""maintain order"" and punish perceived offenders.

According to the Insider, the patterns of abuse of Russian soldiers in Ukraine ""borrow heavily from Soviet labor camp traditions.""

Russian units have employed ""punishment squads"" that seek out soldiers who are abusing alcohol, refuse orders, or are simply disliked, and then subject them to a variety of abuse, including beatings and ""confinement pits.""

A report in Foreign Policy in 2023 detailed a decades-long system of ""sadistic hazing"" in the Russian army that included one soldier who had to have his legs and genitals amputated after he was forced to squat in the snow for several hours.

The video released by Ukraine's Airborne Assault Forces shows at least eight Russian soldiers interviewed at an undisclosed location.

One describes being sent to the front less than a month ago and being ""blown up immediately,"" leaving just two men alive in his unit. Another said his unit was left to dig trenches and fend for themselves when they were spotted by a Ukrainian drone and ""after that everything fell apart.""

""The prisoners were provided with the necessary medical and psychological assistance,"" the military said.

Intercepted calls released by Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) suggest numerous abuses by Russian commanders against their own troops, including one incident where one lost his temper and ordered his soldiers to shoot at their own comrades in a neighbouring unit.

""F**k the 55th (an adjacent Russian unit), shoot them, that’s the battalion commander’s order, shoot them,"" a Russian commander can be heard saying in an audio published by HUR on April 5.

The unidentified Russian commander appears frustrated at the adjacent Russian unit for not properly following an order and revealing their positions to Ukrainian troops.

The Kyiv Independent couldn't independently verify the authenticity of the audio published by HUR.

Russian military freight train blown up en route to Crimea, Ukraine's HUR claims

A Russian military train carrying fuel and food was blown up overnight on June 1 near Melitopol, according to Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR).

""The Muscovites' key logistical artery on the occupied territory of Zaporizhzhia Oblast and Crimea has been destroyed,"" HUR's statement said.

The agency stopped short of claiming responsibility for blowing up the Russian train station in southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, but said ""the fight against the military logistics of the Russian occupiers continues.""

HUR's statement further noted heightened Russian searches and stricter checkpoints in the region as Russian forces seek to find those responsible.

Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian partisan group Atesh claimed to have sabotaged a railway in occupied Donetsk Oblast.

Ukrainian Land Forces Commander resigns after Russian attack that killed 12 soldiers on training grounds

The head of the Land Forces of Ukraine resigned on June 1 following a Russian attack that killed 12 service members under his command.

""I have made the decision to file a letter of resignation from the position of Commander of the Land Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,"" Major General Mykhailo Drapatyi in a statement on Telegram.

""Twelve dead. There are injured. These are young lads from the training battalion. Most of them were in shelters. They should have learned, lived, and fought – not died.""

Drapatyi was referring to an incident in the morning of June 1 in which a Russian missile attack struck a training field and killed 12 soldiers and wounded 60 more. The field was at the time unidentified, but Drapatiy named it as the 239th Polygon, north of the city of Dnipro.

Russia has targeted Ukrainian training grounds aggressively in recent months. The 239th Polygon was also the site of a similar attack with an Iskander ballistic missile in March.

At the time, Drapatyi wrote: ""Everyone who made decisions that day, and everyone who did not make them on time, will be held accountable. No one will hide behind explanations or formal reports.""

In its announcement of the June 1 attack, the Land Forces press office wrote: ""In the event of a determination that the action or inaction of responsible individuals led to the death and injury of servicemen, those responsible will be brought to strict accountability.""

Zelensky announced on June 1 an updated 14-member Ukrainian delegation for upcoming peace talks with Russia in Istanbul, expanding the original group of 12.

Defense Minister Rustem Umerov will again lead the delegation, which will include several new figures from Ukraine's military, human rights, and legal sectors.

Three officials – Andrii Fomin, Yurii Kovbasa, and Yevhenii Ostrianskyi – will participate for the first time, while Oleksii Malovatskyi, involved in the May 16 talks, will not join.

The meeting is scheduled to take place on June 2, with both Russian and Ukrainian delegations expected to attend. Also, security advisors from the U.S., U.K., France, and Germany plan to attend, according to U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg.

Russia has not officially submitted its memorandum outlining peace terms, but Ukraine plans to present a detailed roadmap aimed at securing a lasting settlement.

According to the proposal, the process would begin with a minimum 30-day ceasefire, followed by a full exchange of prisoners and the return of Ukrainian children taken to Russian-held areas, ultimately leading to a potential meeting between Zelensky and Putin. The plan was reported on June 1 by Reuters, which reviewed a copy of the document.

While the U.S. and Ukraine have pushed for an unconditional ceasefire, the Kremlin has rejected it.

Instead, Moscow has regularly voiced maximalist demands that are unlikely to be accepted by Kyiv, such as recognition of Russia's illegal annexation of Ukrainian regions and withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the parts of these regions remaining under Kyiv’s control.

Trump has expressed frustration with Russia's reluctance to make concessions and its intensifying and deadly attacks on Ukraine. However, he has so far refused to sanction Russia.

The talks are tentatively still set to continue on June 2, though Russia has not officially commented yet, following Ukraine’s ""Spider Web"" drone operation earlier today.

May was colder and gloomier than usual — both in weather and in mood. Grey skies and damp ground seemed to echo the uncertainty facing Ukraine as the war entered yet another month.

It began with a diplomatic reset following a tense exchange between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in February. Ukraine signed a long-awaited strategic minerals agreement with the U.S., marking a step forward in bilateral cooperation.

On the battlefield, Ukraine launched a new wave of long-range drone strikes that reached deep into Russian territory, targeting airports, defense industries, and even disrupting the lead up to Moscow’s symbolic Victory Day parade. For the first time, sea drones were used to take down Russian fighter jets.

Despite Russia’s announcement of a ""Victory Day truce"" on May 9, fighting continued along the front lines.

On May 14, intelligence reports warned of a potential new Russian offensive. Tensions escalated along the Donetsk front, while a Russian troop buildup near Sumy raised alarms about a possible incursion from the north.

After an unexpected decision from the Kremlin, direct peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow resumed in Istanbul on May 16 after a three-year pause.

Moscow insisted on returning to the 2022 negotiation framework — which effectively demanded Ukraine’s surrender, conditions Kyiv and its allies rejected. Still, the meeting resulted in a major humanitarian breakthrough — the largest prisoner exchange to date, with 1,000 prisoners of war on each side returning home.

But while it was taking place, Ukraine was hit by three nights of heavy Russian missile and drone strikes, killing and injuring dozens, including children.

On May 24, Kyiv suffered one of the most intense air assaults in months, even as Ukraine continued to call for a U.S.-backed 30-day ceasefire — a proposal Russia continues to reject for a third month.

With talks expected to resume in early June, Ukraine remains under pressure. The demands from Moscow have not changed — give up NATO aspirations and cede occupied territory.

But for now, Ukraine continues to fight, adapt, and endure — a story captured in each image from this turbulent May.

The Kyiv Independent partners with the Ukrainian Association of Professional Photographers to look back at some of May's most memorable moments through the eyes of Ukrainian photographers.

As Ukraine and Russia prepare for peace talks scheduled for June 2 in Istanbul, few observers expect a breakthrough.

While the U.S. and Ukraine have pushed for an unconditional ceasefire, the Kremlin has rejected it.

Instead, Moscow has regularly voiced maximalist demands that are unlikely to be accepted by Kyiv, such as recognition of Russia's illegal annexation of Ukrainian regions and withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the parts of these regions remaining under Kyiv’s control.

U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed frustration with Russia's reluctance to make concessions and its intensifying and deadly attacks on Ukraine. However, he has so far refused to sanction Russia.

Jenny Mathers, a lecturer in international politics at the U.K.'s Aberystwyth University, said that ""(Russian President Vladimir) Putin is clearly engaged in a balancing act between making gestures towards peace to keep Trump quiet without making any compromises or actually trying to ensure that the peace talks make any real progress.""

""There are no signs that Russia is willing to consider making any concessions, and every sign that Russia intends to keep pushing ahead on the battlefield to try to take control of as much Ukrainian territory as possible,"" she told the Kyiv Independent.

No breakthrough during the first round

During the first round of talks in Istanbul on May 16, the two sides failed to reach agreement on a 30-day ceasefire. The only concrete result of the Istanbul talks was a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner swap completed on May 25 — the biggest prisoner exchange during the war.

Ukraine sent a delegation headed by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to Istanbul, while Russia sent a low-level delegation led by Putin's aide Vladimir Medinsky.

Putin did not attend the Istanbul peace talks, despite an invitation from President Volodymyr Zelensky to meet him face-to-face.

""The talks did yield a quite sizable exchange of prisoners,"" Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, told the Kyiv Independent. ""But the glass was more half empty than half full. Putin refused to send a high-level delegation and seemingly little progress was made on the key issue — attaining a ceasefire and durable settlement.""

Peter Rough, a senior fellow at Hudson Institute, also argued that the first round ""didn’t produce a strategic breakthrough and is more interesting procedurally in that it put Russian and Ukrainian negotiators face-to-face.""

""Russia was just going through the motions of talks — showing up and issuing a set of demands before going home,"" Mathers said. ""It was striking that the team for the talks with Ukraine was composed of more junior people than the team sent for talks with the U.S. weeks earlier — this was almost certainly a calculated insult to the Ukrainians.""

Russia dragging its feet on the memo

Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on May 28 that Ukraine had submitted its memorandum on proposed ceasefire terms to Russia.

Ukraine’s proposed memorandum to Russia includes provisions for a ceasefire on land, in the air, and at sea, to be monitored by international partners, The New York Times (NYT) reported on May 30, citing an unnamed senior Ukrainian official.

During the Istanbul talks, Russia also promised to submit a memorandum outlining its ceasefire conditions to Ukraine. However, the Kremlin has been dragging its feet on presenting the document.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced on May 23 that Moscow would present the memorandum immediately after the completion of the prisoner exchange between the two countries. However, the memo was not submitted after the exchange was completed on May 25.

Lavrov announced on May 28 that the Russian memorandum would be unveiled during the next round of negotiations set for June 2 in Istanbul.

""Russia is dragging its feet for two reasons,"" Kupchan said. ""First, Russia has been advancing on the battlefield, which encourages the Kremlin to keep the war going. Second, Putin has not yet given up on his maximalist war aims and seeks to subjugate as much of Ukraine as possible. He will stop only when Ukraine has the military wherewithal to stop him, which is why Europe and the United States need to keep the arms flowing.""

Meanwhile, Stefan Wolff, professor of international security at the University of Birmingham, argued that Russia wants ""to limit the time that Ukraine has to consider the Russian demands and discuss them with their allies in Europe and the U.S.""

""Dragging out the negotiations process buys Russia time for further advances on the battlefield and improving and shoring up their position ahead of a ceasefire agreement that will most likely freeze the front lines,"" he added.

Russia's maximalist demands

During the talks, Russia has consistently stuck to its maximalist demands and refused to make concessions.

Putin said in March that Russia would agree to a ceasefire only if there was a ban on Ukrainian mobilization and training of troops and a halt on Western military aid for Kyiv. Experts argue that these conditions are tantamount to demands for Ukraine's surrender.

Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's envoy to the United Nations, reiterated the demands on May 30, saying that Russia would only consider a ceasefire if Kyiv stopped receiving Western weapons and halted mobilization.

During the Istanbul talks, Russia also demanded that Ukraine recognize the illegally annexed territories as Russian, withdraw from the Kyiv-controlled parts of these regions, and adopt a neutral status, according to a source in the President’s Office who spoke with the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity.

Russia illegally annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014. The Kremlin also announced the illegal annexation of Ukraine's Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts in 2022 despite only partially controlling them.

Reuters reported on May 28, citing its sources, that Putin was demanding a written pledge by NATO not to accept more Eastern European members and the lifting of several sanctions as conditions for ending Russia's war in Ukraine.

Trump frustrated but fails to act

As Russia remained intransigent, Trump has continued his usual rhetoric, alternating between praise for Putin and frustration with Russia's actions.

During a phone call with Trump on May 19, Putin again rejected an unconditional ceasefire. Despite this, Trump said the call ""went very well"" and once again refused to impose sanctions against Russia.

In recent weeks, Trump has repeatedly expressed frustration with Russia.

Some of Trump's critical statements followed massive Russian drone and missile strikes from May 24 to May 26 — one of Russia's largest and deadliest aerial attacks during the war.

On May 25, Trump said that Putin had gone ""absolutely"" crazy and warned that if he didn’t stop his actions, it could bring about the collapse of Russia.

At the same time, Trump also lashed out at Zelensky, saying that he ""is doing his country no favors by talking the way he does"" — an apparent reference to Zelensky's criticism of Russia and of Washington's failure to crack down on Putin.

On May 27, Trump also admitted that ""if it weren't for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia.”

Trump has also repeatedly threatened to impose sanctions on Russia but no action followed.

The U.S. Senate is considering a bill that would impose 500% tariffs on imports from countries purchasing Russian oil, gas, uranium, and other products.

The Senate is expected to ""start moving"" the bill next week, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on May 30.

However, it is still unclear if Trump will back the bill.

""Trump appears to be getting frustrated with Putin and may be arriving at the conclusion that Putin is playing for time rather than working with Trump to end the war,"" Kupchan said. ""The massive Russian air attacks that keep coming reinforce the view that Russia is not negotiating in good faith.""

At the same time, there is no indication that Trump's threats will lead to any action.

""One of the constants in Trump's behavior has been his tendency to be sympathetic to Russia's positions and arguments and to regard Putin with respect,"" Mathers said. ""Despite brief expressions of frustration and irritation, Trump always seems to return to his default setting of finding Russia's arguments persuasive and being eager to get rid of obstacles to doing business with and in Russia.""

Wolff also argued that ""for Trump, a deal with Russia, any deal, is really important.""

""Too much pressure on Putin, in Trump’s mind, is probably counter-productive to get a deal done,"" he added. ""By contrast, pressure on Ukraine seems like an easier option, including because the U.S. has, or at least thinks it has, more leverage over Kyiv.""

Any hope for the future?

As Trump remains reluctant to punish Russia, the Kremlin appears to have no incentives to agree to a ceasefire.

Analysts are skeptical about the possibility of a breakthrough during the second round of talks.

""Russia does not yet seem prepared to make the concessions and compromises needed to get a ceasefire,"" Kupchan said. ""There are as yet no signs that Putin is negotiating in good faith and making a sincere effort to end the war.""

Michael O'Hanlon, director of research in the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution, said that ""we will need to turn up the pressure on Putin in several ways for talks to have any real chance of success.""

""I don’t expect much from June 2,"" he added. ""President Trump is learning that Putin is the problem but hasn’t fully accepted or internalized that fact yet.""

Analysts agree that the main problem is Trump’s failure to realize that sanctions would be the only realistic way to push the Kremlin towards a ceasefire.

“Putin seems to believe that time is on Russia's side and that Trump will not impose serious constraints on Russia, so Russia is free to demand preconditions that make a ceasefire impossible,” Richard Betts, professor emeritus of war and peace studies at Columbia University, told the Kyiv Independent.

“This might change if Russia suffers some defeats on the battlefield, or political support for Putin within Russia drops, but there is no evidence yet that either of those conditions is likely to occur soon.”",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/06/GettyImages-2216570751.jpg

The head of the Land Forces of Ukraine resigned on June 1 following a Russian attack that killed 12 service members under his command.

""I have made the decision to file a letter of resignation from the position of Commander of the Land Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,"" Major General Mykhailo Drapatyi in a statement on Telegram.

""Twelve dead. There are injured. These are young lads from the training battalion. Most of them were in shelters. They should have learned, lived, and fought – not died.""

Russia has targeted Ukrainian training grounds aggressively in recent months. The 239th Polygon was also the site of a similar attack with an Iskander ballistic missile in March.

At the time, Drapatyi wrote: ""Everyone who made decisions that day, and everyone who did not make them on time, will be held accountable. No one will hide behind explanations or formal reports.""

The U.K. is looking to revamp its defense capabilities and on the wish list of new weapons are U.S.-made fighter jets capable of launching tactical nuclear weapons to, in part, counter the threat from Russia, the Sunday Times reported on June 1.

The British military has a substantial nuclear arsenal, but after decommissioning a number of platforms at the end of the Cold War, can today only launch such weapons from its submarines.

According to the Sunday Times, the new air fleet will form a key part of the UK's strategic defense review, set to go public on June 2.

The military is looking at F-35A Lightning stealth fighter jets, made by Lockheed Martin, the report says.

The review is largely in response to the increasing risk of state-on-state warfare, specifically the threat of a Russian attack. In other line items from the pending review, the U.K. government is asking for £6 billion ($8 billion) for more ammunition, to be manufactured in six new factories, as well as a boost in the number of the navy's fleet of destroyers and frigates from 14 to 25.

The U.K. government will also consider a new missile defense shield capable of protecting against prospective ballistic attacks.

The broad plan is to boost British defense spending to 3% of GDP. But the projected timeframe for that boost is between now and 2034.

A group of Russian soldiers fighting in the Kursk direction surrendered to Ukrainian paratroopers because ""abuse in units is worse than captivity,"" Ukraine's Airborne Assault Forces said in a video posted on social media on May 31.

""In their units on the territory of the Russian Federation, they were subjected to inhumane treatment, psychological pressure and threats,"" the post reads.

Russia's abuse of its own soldiers has been well documented throughout the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

An investigation by the Insider last July reported that Russia uses a systematic program of ""gulag-style"" abuse directed at its soldiers in Ukraine in order to ""maintain order"" and punish perceived offenders.

According to the Insider, the patterns of abuse of Russian soldiers in Ukraine ""borrow heavily from Soviet labor camp traditions.""

Russian units have employed ""punishment squads"" that seek out soldiers who are abusing alcohol, refuse orders, or are simply disliked, and then subject them to a variety of abuse, including beatings and ""confinement pits.""

A report in Foreign Policy in 2023 detailed a decades-long system of ""sadistic hazing"" in the Russian army that included one soldier who had to have his legs and genitals amputated after he was forced to squat in the snow for several hours.

The video released by Ukraine's Airborne Assault Forces shows at least eight Russian soldiers interviewed at an undisclosed location.

One describes being sent to the front less than a month ago and being ""blown up immediately,"" leaving just two men alive in his unit. Another said his unit was left to dig trenches and fend for themselves when they were spotted by a Ukrainian drone and ""after that everything fell apart.""

""The prisoners were provided with the necessary medical and psychological assistance,"" the military said.

Intercepted calls released by Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) suggest numerous abuses by Russian commanders against their own troops, including one incident where one lost his temper and ordered his soldiers to shoot at their own comrades in a neighbouring unit.

""F**k the 55th (an adjacent Russian unit), shoot them, that’s the battalion commander’s order, shoot them,"" a Russian commander can be heard saying in an audio published by HUR on April 5.

The unidentified Russian commander appears frustrated at the adjacent Russian unit for not properly following an order and revealing their positions to Ukrainian troops.

Operatives with the group destroyed a relay box on the new Volnovakha-Mariupol railway, which was recently built by occupying Russian forces. As a result, the railway signalling and traffic control system was disrupted, Atesh said.

The impacted railway has been reportedly used by Russian forces to deliver fuel, equipment, and ammunition directly to the frontline.

The Volnovakha-Mariupol railway connects occupied Donetsk oblast to Taganrog, a city in southwestern Russia, allowing Moscow's military forces to bypass Crimea and transfer cargo faster and with fewer risks, according to Atesh.

A German official has called on the European Union to take a ""closer look"" at the issue of frozen Russian assets and using them to support Ukraine, stressing the need to take a harder stance against the Kremlin.

Thorsten Frei, Head of the German Chancellery, stated in an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung on May 31 that the EU should ""take a much closer look at the issue of Russian state funds than we have so far.""

He also urged the EU to take a more assertive position against Moscow, adding that ""we must not allow the game that Russia is playing with us to go unchallenged.""

The question of frozen Russian assets, and what to do with them, has been discussed by the EU and other Western countries since the start of the full-scale invasion. Recently, the Group of Seven – including Germany – pledged to keep Russian assets frozen until the end of the war.

Frei's comments suggest that Germany's new Chancellor Friedrich Merz may be open to the idea of seizing the approximately €200 billion ($227 billion) in Russian state assets in the EU.

Frei also mentioned the 18th package of EU sanctions currently under preparation, citing them as an example of tougher measures against Russia. According to Frei, the upcoming sanctions are a response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's refusal to comply with demands for a ceasefire.

""Measures are being prepared that are tougher than before, and which some European states have therefore shied away from so far,"" Frei said, stressing that the sanctions package will have ""far-reaching punitive measures.""

Frei added that the sanctions package will target Russia's shadow fleet, energy sector, financial sector, and Nord Stream pipelines.

The ruling Georgian Dream party, which currently holds a parliamentary majority, passed the contentious law earlier in April 2025, alongside other ""repressive measures [that] threaten the very survival of Georgia’s democratic foundations and the future of its citizens in a free and open society.""

The statement also noted that Georgia's ""accession process has been de facto halted."" Georgia first received EU candidate status in December 2023, but its accession process has been hampered by growing authoritarianism in the country.

The EU reiterated its call for Georgian authorities to heeds their citizens' demands for democracy and a European future and urged the ""release all unjustly detained journalists, activists, protesters, and political leaders.""

""The EU is ready to consider the return of Georgia to the EU accession path if the authorities take credible steps to reverse democratic backsliding,"" the statement emphasized. ""The responsibility lies solely with the Georgian authorities.""



Mass protests erupted in Georgia following the contentious parliamentary elections in October 2024, in which Georgian Dream maintained its majority amidst reports of ballot stuffing, intimidation, and other electoral irregularities. Protestors have also cited the foreign agents law as a source of discontent.

Georgia's foreign agents law closely mirrors a similar law that was passed in Russia and weaponized by the Kremlin to clamp down on civil society. First introduced in 2012 and significantly expanded in 2022, Russia's foreign agents law is yet another one of Moscow's primary tools for suppressing criticism.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178801643-1.jpg

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on May 31 that there remains no clarity on Russia’s position ahead of the upcoming peace talks in Istanbul, raising doubts about Moscow’s intentions.

Zelensky emphasized that Ukraine and its partners are still waiting to see what, if anything, Russia plans to present, he said in his evening video address. ""We don’t have it, Turkey doesn’t have it, the United States doesn’t have it, and neither do our other partners,"" Zelensky said. ""At this point, it looks far from serious.""

Moscow has proposed June 2 as the date for the next round of talks with Ukraine in Istanbul but has yet to deliver a promised negotiations memorandum. Russia's Foreign Ministry previously claimed that its delegation, led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, would present the ceasefire framework at the upcoming talks.

Ukraine's Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said Ukraine has already shared its position paper with Russia.

Zelensky noted that Ukraine is actively preparing diplomatic initiatives in coordination with European and American partners. ""We are currently preparing new diplomatic steps together with our European partners and, very importantly, with our partners in the United States,"" he said. ""We're in constant communication with everyone who can make diplomacy meaningful.""

The president also said he had spoken with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan about the issue the day before, reiterating that Ukraine is committed to pursuing a meaningful ceasefire. ""Of course, everyone in the world wants diplomacy to work and for an actual ceasefire to take place. Everyone wants Russia to stop playing games with diplomacy and end the war,"" Zelensky said.

""We want a serious peace — and Russia must agree to that. That should be the agenda of the meetings. We have already presented our agenda.

Russia-aligned influence campaigns have intensified efforts to spread disinformation targeting Ukrainian refugees in Poland ahead of the country’s presidential runoff election on June 1, according to a new investigation by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD).

ISD found that Russia-aligned actors are amplifying anti-Ukrainian sentiment through coordinated campaigns across platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Bluesky, Facebook, and Telegram. These efforts include operations like ""Operation Overload"" and the pro-Kremlin network ""Pravda/Portal Kombat,"" which use impersonation, AI-generated content, and coordinated amplification to push false narratives.

One Operation Overload campaign claimed that Ukrainian refugees were preparing terrorist attacks targeting the Polish elections, garnering over 654,000 views and nearly 5,800 interactions on X. Another falsely accused Ukrainians of plotting attacks on politicians in neighboring countries.

The investigation, published on May 30, highlighted that ChatGPT replicated misleading claims from the Pravda network, including accusations that Ukrainians were responsible for a rise in violent crime in Poland. A satirical video about refugees was manipulated by a pro-Kremlin influencer to portray Ukrainians as exploiting Poland’s welfare system, sparking calls for deportations and online hate. The influencer’s post alone received 161,500 views, 900 shares, and 380 comments, many of which were derogatory.

ISD warns that immigration has become a key issue in the Polish election discourse, noting that both remaining presidential candidates have taken positions targeting Ukrainian refugees. Candidate Rafal Trzaskowski proposed halting child benefits for non-working refugees, while Karol Nawrocki suggested placing them last in line for public services. The investigation urges Polish authorities to remain vigilant against Russia-backed disinformation that fuels discrimination and societal division.

ISD also calls on platforms to meet their obligations under the EU’s Digital Services Act by clearly labeling AI-generated content and addressing systemic risks to electoral integrity. The European Commission is urged to expand enforcement of sanctions on Russian-linked aggregators and to coordinate with internet service providers to counter foreign information manipulation more effectively.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2215673691.jpg

Former U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo warned against recognizing Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea and other Ukrainian territories seized by force, calling it ""a mistake of epic proportions"" during remarks at the Black Sea Security Forum in Odesa on May 31.

Pompeo acknowledged frustrations over the current front lines but cautioned against ceding Ukrainian land to Russia. ""I get the frustration … I’m not naive about what’s physically possible in this moment, but that doesn’t mean one should go and say, 'and we are giving up for all time,'"" he said, according to The Hill. ""This is one of the things I hope to communicate.""

The remarks come as the Trump administration considers granting Russia de jure recognition over territories it occupies in Ukraine as part of ongoing ceasefire negotiations. Ukraine is under pressure to agree to a ceasefire without regaining all of its territory, but Kyiv is urging allies not to legitimize Russian control over occupied regions.

""Crimea will stay with Russia. And (President Volodymyr) Zelensky understands that, and everybody understands that it's been with them for a long time,"" U.S. President Donald Trump said in interview with Time magazine on April 22.

Trump has been pushing both sides for a peace deal to end the war at all costs, threatening to walk away if there is no progress made in the near future. Trump's recent messages suggest that he started growing impatient with Russia's President Vladimir Putin.

On May 28, Trump said that the United States would soon find out whether Putin is genuinely interested in ending the war in Ukraine, cautioning that if Moscow is merely stalling, Washington would ""respond a little bit differently.""

In Odesa, Pompeo reiterated his 2018 Crimea Declaration, issued during Trump’s first term, in which the U.S. rejected Russia’s claims to Ukrainian territory captured by force.

While Trump has since distanced himself from Pompeo, the former secretary said he continues to make the case on Capitol Hill for maintaining the declaration. He named Senator Lindsey Graham, a vocal supporter of Ukraine, as one of the allies he spoke to during his visit to Ukraine.

""There are many in my party, the Republican party, that have disappointed me deeply and have said things that are inconsistent with what I think are the deep American interests that we have here,"" Pompeo said. He added, ""But I think they all also know, that, in the end, there’s no walking away from this for the United States.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2162600946.jpg

OPEC+ will boost oil production by 411,000 barrels per day in July, marking the third consecutive monthly increase and reinforcing a major strategic shift that has driven crude prices to a four-year low.

Key producers, including Saudi Arabia, agreed to the supply hike during a virtual meeting on May 31, following similarly sized increases set for May and June, delegates familiar with the talks told Bloomberg.

The move continues to diverge from OPEC+’s longstanding approach of curbing output to maintain high oil prices. Russia, a major partner in the alliance, reportedly proposed pausing the increases but was overruled. Delegates asked not to be named due to the private nature of the negotiations.

Oil briefly dropped below $60 per barrel in April after OPEC+ announced the output increases, despite weak global demand and the ongoing impact of President Donald Trump’s trade war. Prices have since rebounded slightly, with Brent crude trading around $64 in London.

Analysts and officials have pointed to a range of motives behind Saudi Arabia’s policy change. Some suggest Riyadh is trying to placate Trump, others argue the kingdom is seeking to regain market share lost to U.S. shale producers and other competitors. Additional theories include punishing members such as Kazakhstan and Iraq for exceeding their output quotas, or simply responding to unexpectedly strong demand.

On May 28, President Volodymyr Zelensky visited Germany and met with the country’s new Chancellor, Friedrich Merz. There were high expectations that Berlin would finally authorize the delivery of Taurus long-range missiles — a long-standing request from Kyiv since the beginning of the Russian invasion.

However, this demand had been systematically rejected by former Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who feared dragging Germany into a direct confrontation with Moscow.

Instead of Taurus missiles, Merz announced a new 5 billion euro aid package and a commitment that Germany would support the production of long-range weapons on Ukrainian territory.

Although these systems are not as sophisticated as the Taurus — whose operation would require months of training — the models to be co-produced by Berlin and Kyiv have the advantage of being easier to use, which could accelerate their integration into the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

While investing in Ukraine’s defense industry is necessary — something President Zelensky himself has emphasized in urging allies to strengthen the country’s defensive capabilities — the fact that he returned from Germany without a Taurus delivery promise reveals a deeper issue.

These missiles represent not only a powerful symbolic gesture, demonstrating that the West is truly committed to Ukraine’s defense, but also an immediate and tangible impact on the battlefield.

As recently highlighted by the Kyiv Independent, the Taurus missile can be programmed to detonate only after penetrating multiple layers of protection, making it especially effective against strategic targets like the Crimean Bridge.

Beyond being an important symbol for Russian President Vladimir Putin, that bridge is a crucial logistical link between mainland Russia and the occupied peninsula — a target of both symbolic and operational significance.

The absence of the Taurus in this package highlights a familiar blind spot: many Western governments still underestimate how much timing matters.

In a war, it’s not just about how much support is given, but how quickly it comes. Delays in key decisions don’t just slow progress — they quietly erode Ukraine’s position on the ground.

Has the West become so focused on the latest headlines, diplomatic theater, and talks in Istanbul that it has forgotten to reflect on its own recent history and the decisions made over the past three years?

The truth is that the West sabotages itself by delaying the release of essential resources — a hesitation systematically exploited by Russia.

That was the case with the F-16 fighter jets: the U.S. and European countries, initially fearful of escalation, delayed their delivery by more than a year — only relenting after intense Ukrainian pressure and decisive support from countries like the Netherlands and Denmark.

The same pattern occurred with the Leopard 2 tanks, delivered only in early 2023; with the UK’s Challenger 2 tanks, which arrived in March 2023; and with the U.S. M1 Abrams, delivered only in September that year — a year and a half after the invasion.

Even Patriot air defense systems, vital for intercepting Russian missiles, faced initial resistance due to escalation fears and were only delivered in early 2023. Storm Shadow cruise missiles likewise only began arriving in May 2023. Given all this, the inevitable question is: why so much hesitation, if in the end they give in anyway?

Russia, unlike its Western counterparts, has shown no hesitation when it comes to speed — whether in advancing troops or manipulating diplomacy.

Every so-called negotiation is just another stalling tactic, with the Kremlin expertly layering new steps, new demands, and new distractions to stretch the clock. After the first Istanbul round, came the promise of a “memorandum”, only to be followed by yet another “new phase.”

It’s a script they’ve used repeatedly: feign interest, pretend flexibility, and use the time gained to recalibrate offensives.

U.S. President Donald Trump, for his part, appears to have started losing patience with Putin — but that frustration hasn’t translated into any concrete action. Instead, he ends up playing straight into Moscow’s hands, a convenient figure in a Kremlin-scripted performance designed to drain Western resolve and dress delay up as diplomacy.

The race faced by Ukraine and its European allies is, above all, a race against time — and many still don’t seem to realize it. For Europeans, this race involves rebuilding strategic autonomy in defense — a process that should have begun over a decade ago, with the annexation of Crimea.

At the very latest, the alarm bells should have rung in 2017, when Trump, then president, openly threatened to pull the U.S. out of NATO and, on one occasion when asked about Russian election interference, said he trusted Putin over his own intelligence agencies.

The signs were there, flashing red — but Europe chose to look away. Now, the cost of that complacency is becoming impossible to ignore.

For Ukrainians, this race against time is even more literal: every day counts, and every delay can mean a new Russian offensive. At this very moment, Russia is mobilizing around 50,000 troops near the border with Sumy — potentially signaling not just an attempt to create the “buffer zone” Putin has demanded, but preparations for a new large-scale military advance.

None of this is to downplay the support Europe has already provided — it’s been essential. But that doesn’t mean it’s been enough, or delivered with the urgency the moment demands. While Putin takes advantage of U.S. ambiguity, Europe often falls into the trap of responding with long-term commitments that, although important, have little immediate effect on the battlefield.

Trump, despite his recent tough rhetoric, continues to offer Moscow concessions before they’re even requested.

In February 2025, he stated, “I’d love to have them back. I think it was a mistake to throw them out,” referring to Russia’s expulsion from the G8 after the annexation of Crimea. It’s exactly the kind of signal that undermines Western unity and hands the Kremlin an unearned diplomatic win — no pressure needed.

Meanwhile, Europe’s delayed promises may look good on paper, but they don’t change the reality on the ground, where time and resolve are the most decisive weapons.

Gestures like promising Ukraine EU membership by 2030 are certainly meaningful. They send the right message — that Ukraine belongs in the European family and that a future of integration and reconstruction lies ahead.

But these are not messages that deter the Kremlin. Because 2030 is five years away — and in a war where every month can redraw the front lines, that’s a long time.

Ukraine has stunned the world with its resilience, determination, and ability to adapt under extraordinary pressure. But even under U.S. President Joe Biden — a president who, despite his caution and delays, remained firmly committed to Kyiv — 20% of Ukraine’s territory remains under illegal Russian occupation. The question now is: what will Ukraine’s map look like in five years?

Europe, out of fear of escalation, has too often treated Ukraine as a burden. But the truth is that Ukraine should be seen as an opportunity — for integration, for strengthening collective security, and for renewing the European project.

Its Armed Forces, forged in the most demanding conditions, have accumulated real combat experience, developed homegrown technologies, created new drone models, and demonstrated a level of adaptability that many European militaries lack. More than that: Ukraine has kept its institutions functioning and its government operating under the pressure of war — something most European countries would struggle to do.

Ukraine is not just a country in need of help; it’s a partner with valuable capabilities to offer.

Europe must also understand that not every show of strength leads to escalation.

The recent use of the Russian Oreshnik missile against Ukrainian territory — following the U.S. decision in November 2024, under Biden, to authorize Ukraine’s use of ATACMS inside Russia — was a calculated, demonstrative move, not the start of a broader escalation.

In contrast, the unprecedented attacks on Kyiv and other regions in recent days were deliberate Russian actions that didn’t follow any “Ukrainian provocation.” They were likely triggered by something else entirely: the West’s visible hesitation to act more decisively.

When deterrence is delayed or watered down, it doesn’t prevent escalation — it invites it.

The message Moscow will understand is not the one about promises for 2030 — but the one about deliveries tomorrow.

European officials drafting proposals for a Ukraine peacekeeping force acknowledged that Europe must ""get real"" about the possibility of U.S. President Donald Trump abandoning support for Kyiv, the Telegraph reported on May 31 citing undisclosed sources.

According to the Telegraph, senior European diplomats meeting in The Hague agreed to shift their focus from deploying troops to enforce a ceasefire to preparing long-term strategies for supporting Ukraine without American backing.

Previously, the United Kingdom and France led efforts to form a so-called ""coalition of the willing,"" a deterrence force that would be deployed in the event of a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. Leaders of 31 nations met in Paris on March 27 at a summit for the coalition.

While over 30 countries have expressed interest in the coalition, only a few have publicly committed to deploying troops.

""Let's get real and admit the U.S. will never be on board,"" the Telegraph quoted a Western official.

The comments reflect growing unease in European capitals about Trump's continued opposition to Ukraine's accession to NATO and his criticism of Kyiv's war effort. On May 19, Trump reiterated he would abandon efforts to end Russia's war against Ukraine if progress is not made.

One European diplomat said the discussions centered on how to maintain support ""when we assume that the U.S. would only continue providing some specific assets, such as intelligence.""

The discussions also touched on increasing economic pressure on Russia and inviting President Volodymyr Zelensky to the June NATO summit in The Hague, despite concerns about Trump's resistance to Ukraine joining the alliance.

Italy's ANSA news agency reported earlier this month that the United States opposed Zelensky's participation, citing unnamed diplomatic sources. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio denied the claims.

Trump has repeatedly echoed Moscow's narrative that Ukraine's efforts to join NATO have been one of the root causes of the full-scale invasion.

In March, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha firmly opposed any limitations on Ukraine's right to join international organizations, specifically NATO and the European Union, as a condition for reaching a potential peace agreement.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2213759377.jpg

From my vantage point, having recently attended the Kyiv International Cyber Resilience Forum (KICRF) and witnessing firsthand the unwavering determination in the face of relentless digital aggression, the situation unfolding in Ukraine's cyber domain demands our unvarnished attention.

The situation in Ukraine's cyber domain is not merely a theoretical exercise in network security; it directly impacts national sovereignty and societal resilience.

What I observed in Kyiv was a nation locked in a persistent cyber struggle, primarily against the Kremlin's digital legions — The Federal Security Service (FSB), Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) and the Russian criminal actors — now further complicated by a significant shift in the international support landscape. The U.S. government appears to be withdrawing from the cybersecurity battlefield as evidenced by its wholesale reduction in personnel within key government entities, including the Critical Infrastructure Security Agency, and directives from administration leadership not to have national resources focus on Russian cyber activities.

In addition to this, the unexpected closure of the USAID mission in Ukraine, leading to the reduction of support to Ukraine's ongoing cybersecurity efforts, casts a long shadow over Kyiv's digital defenses. This was further highlighted by the palpable concerns expressed during the KICRF and the embarrassing and inexplicable absence of U.S. government participation.

The Russian attacks on Ukraine are multifaceted, targeting critical infrastructure — power grids, telecom networks, the financial system — to inflict maximum disruption, all designed to erode public confidence.

One cannot forget that intelligence gathering remains a constant, insidious undertow. Add to that the weaponization of information and the relentless campaigns to pollute the information space, erode trust, and undermine Ukraine's narrative globally.

Then we have the repeated deployment of wiper malware — digital scorched earth tactics — underscoring the destructive intent. And while ransomware may have a profit motive, its impact on essential services amplifies the overall vulnerability.

Ukraine possesses a cadre of highly skilled cyber professionals, both within government agencies and the private sector, individuals who are actively engaged in the digital war.

However, amid this digital maelstrom, Ukraine demonstrates remarkable resilience and adaptability that demands significant attention and admiration. This is not a nation caught entirely off guard. Years of Russian aggression in the Donbas, the annexation of Crimea, and the 2015 attack on Ukraine's power grid all served as a training ground, forcing Kyiv to harden its digital defenses.

Crucially, the steady hand of international assistance — governments pooling resources through mechanisms like the Tallinn Accord, the strategic guidance of entities like the EU and NATO, and the often-unsung contributions of private sector cyber defenders — has provided a vital lifeline of expertise, technology, and funding.

And let me be clear, Ukraine possesses a cadre of highly skilled cyber professionals, both within government agencies and the private sector, individuals who are actively engaged in the digital war. Their agility, their ability to adapt to evolving threats in real-time, is a testament to their resolve. As we have seen, this adaptability and teamwork are foundational to their cyber resilience.

However, the cessation of USAID's programs, which included significant initiatives in cybersecurity for critical infrastructure and digital transformation — areas where sustained support is paramount — injects a new and unwelcome element of uncertainty. The loss of this funding stream will undoubtedly create gaps in Ukraine's ability to modernize its defenses, train its personnel, and implement crucial security measures. The growing dependence on other international partners intensifies, placing greater pressure on those who remain dedicated to upholding Ukraine's digital sovereignty.

This is where the global cyber ecosystem — both commercial and governmental, now operating with one less major player — faces a starker choice: stand by and watch the digital defenses fray or step into the breach with even greater resolve.

For Ukrainian tech companies, this is not just a crisis; it is an even more urgent imperative to innovate under pressure. The demand for tailored cybersecurity solutions — threat intelligence platforms with local context, rapid incident response capabilities, and secure communication channels designed for a hostile environment — is now amplified.

Investing in the next generation of cyber defenders through robust training and education programs is paramount. Strategic alliances with trusted international partners are no longer a luxury; they are a necessity for accelerated technology and knowledge transfer.

For international companies, the call to action is now imbued with a greater sense of urgency.

Providing Ukraine with access to the sharpest cyber tools — AI-driven threat detection, advanced endpoint protection, resilient cloud infrastructure — isn't just good PR; it is a strategic necessity to compensate for the receding U.S. presence.

Investing in Ukraine's tech sector, establishing a local footprint, or forging genuine partnerships contributes to long-term stability and fills a growing void. More is needed to offset the USAID withdrawal.

The timely sharing of actionable threat intelligence is a cornerstone of the collective digital defense, now even more critical with potentially reduced intelligence sharing through formal U.S. channels. Supporting and contributing to cybersecurity education initiatives helps build a sustainable talent pipeline, which is crucial in light of potential limitations in U.S.-funded programs. Engaging in meaningful public-private partnerships and leveraging the unique strengths of all stakeholders are the only ways to build truly resilient defenses in this evolving landscape.

Russia's cyber activity knows no geographic boundary. We must reject the notion that Russia's illegal war targets only Ukraine; Russia is at war with everyone.

This is not about charity; it is about safeguarding the integrity of the global digital commons in the face of a persistent and emboldened adversary whose digital reach extends far beyond the physical borders of Ukraine. The imperative — and the heightened responsibility – to act decisively is now upon us. The unexpected withdrawal of a major player, the United States, only amplifies the urgency for others to step forward and fill the digital breach, recognizing that the digital front line in Ukraine is a frontline for us all.

Reports of an imminent Russian summer offensive and troop build ups on Ukraine's border are raising alarms in Sumy Oblast and fears that a large-scale assault could be on the horizon.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 22 said he had ordered his military to create a ""security buffer zone"" along the border, and President Volodymyr Zelensky later claimed 50,000 of Moscow's troops were amassed ""in the direction of Sumy.""

""These are trained combat units — airborne troops, marines, those that were specially transferred to displace our troops,"" a source in Ukraine's defense forces told the Kyiv Independent.

Russian forces have already launched limited offensive operations and captured a small number of villages in the oblast, but soldiers and experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent say the Kremlin's full intentions remain murky.

Adding to the information fog, journalists’ access to Sumy Oblast has been limited by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) since the withdrawal from Kursk Oblast, and the Ukrainian military has shared little information on the front-line situation.

When contacted by the Kyiv Independent, the Ukrainian military command of Kursk Oblast declined to comment, citing a ""limited"" ability to comment on the situation in the area.



Sumy Oblast and the Kursk operation

The warning of a renewed Russian push into Sumy Oblast comes two months after Ukrainian troops had to withdraw from Russia’s adjacent Kursk Oblast after losing the logistics hub town of Sudzha.

As soon as Ukraine’s costly Kursk operation died out, Russian troops took the momentum and began raids into Sumy Oblast, depriving Kyiv of the opportunity to recover and rebuild the defenses there.

Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump continues to push for peace talks to end the war at all costs, with Ukraine and Russia planning to meet again in Istanbul on June 2 despite previous talks yielding minimal results.

The Ukrainian troops on the ground

Uncertain of what might lay ahead, Ukrainian soldiers on the ground are bracing for tougher days.

With many units exhausted after seven months of holding onto the Kursk salient under heavy Russian first-person view (FPV) drones and glide bombs, Kyiv’s ability to hold the Sumy Oblast defense would depend on how it can reinforce the area despite a manpower shortage.

Ukrainian local authorities admitted on May 26 that Russia has already captured four border villages in Sumy Oblast, including Novenke, Zhuravka, Veselivka, and Basivka.

Russian troops were deploying the now-familiar tactics of using small assault groups, relying on ""fast movement"" with quad bikes, according to a deputy company commander with the 80th Air Assault Brigade, who goes by his callsign Third.

""Only time will tell (how prepared Ukraine is),"" he told the Kyiv Independent.

Russia is conducting small assaults most actively in the areas of the Zhuravka and Basivka villages, but it has also widened ""the attempt zone"" using similar tactics, according to the State Border Guard Service spokesperson Andriy Demchenko.

Russian forces have also begun pushing westward, near the villages of Veselivka and Volodymyrivka, but are reportedly suffering heavy losses.

""Despite the fact that the enemy is suffering losses, we see that they openly do not give a damn about their soldiers,"" Demchenko told the Kyiv Independent.

How far does Russia plan to advance into Sumy Oblast?

The scale at which Russia plans to advance into Sumy Oblast is unclear. So far, it has been a gradual push over the past few weeks, slowly capturing the border villages, according to Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst at the Finland-based Black Bird Group monitoring the war closely through open sources. He expected it to continue in the near future.

Demchenko from the State Border Guard confirmed to the Kyiv Independent on May 20 that Russia was bringing more equipment into the border area. He said that attacks remained small incursions with squads of infantry using equipment no larger than quad bikes.

It is unclear how much equipment Moscow amassed near Sumy Oblast.

Civilians in Sumy Oblast

A civilian evacuation in Sumy Oblast — a region that has been regularly struck by Russian attacks since 2022 but intensified since the Kursk incursion — is ongoing.

Nearly 56,000 residents were evacuated from Sumy Oblast under mandatory evacuation orders, Governor Oleh Hryhorov said on May 19.

As of May 20, a representative for the Regional Military Administration said that three municipalities — Bilopillya, Vorozhba, and Nova Sloboda — had been asked to evacuate in the preceding month, but said authorities were not yet forcing residents to evacuate.

""As for what's happening on the border itself, only soldiers can answer, but as of today, there's no threat to the oblast from there,"" they told the Kyiv Independent.

While Russian forces will likely continue their ""slow kind of offensive operation"" in the northern border areas of Sumy Oblast, the eastern region of Donbas will likely remain Moscow’s priority, according to Kastehelmi from the Black Bird Group.

He said he would be ""surprised"" if Sumy Oblast became one of the main axes of any Russian summer offensive, given that it would further stretch Moscow’s troops and it could likely achieve more on other fronts, such as the Donbas or the southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast.

""It's likely that the Russians continue to attack in Sumy (Oblast) too, but I would assess it as a secondary direction where they can tie up Ukrainian resources,"" he said.

Border areas are usually difficult to fortify due to raids from both sides and their proximity to Russia, which makes engineering equipment particularly vulnerable to potential attacks.

Kastehelmi said that while Russia appears to have captured more villages than the Ukrainian local authorities had confirmed, the pace has been ""really slow,"" and Moscow could simply be trying to prevent another potential Ukrainian incursion.

""They may try to gain more ground there (in Sumy Oblast), maybe capture a few more villages, but it doesn't really change the general situation if the Russians control just a small sector,"" Kastehelmi said.

The Deputy Company Commander from the 80th brigade, Third, said that the situation near the border was ""more or less normal (and) controlled,"" and Sumy continued to ""live its life to the fullest"" despite the nightly drone attacks.

But the high number of Russian troops deployed near Sumy Oblast still has Ukrainian soldiers on the ground on their toes.

Illia, a serviceman from the 80th brigade, said in mid-May that he was not sure whether there would be an offensive into Sumy Oblast, but expected the assaults to continue.

""There could be an offensive — there could not be as well,"" he told the Kyiv Independent.

The source in Ukraine's defense forces told the Kyiv Independent that Russia's full intentions will depend on whether or not it manages to secure the so-called ""security buffer zone"" ordered by Putin.

""It is clear to us that if they manage to do this, they will go further,"" they said.

""Because Russia's overall goal has not changed — to occupy all of Ukraine.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2217470007.jpg

Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on May 31 that Russian forces have ramped up assault operations across key fronts in Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Sumy oblasts.

""(Russian troops) have notably increased activity in the Zaporizhzhia direction, where they are conducting active offensive actions,"" Syrskyi said following a strategic meeting assessing military operations in May.

According to Syrskyi, Ukraine's Armed Forces are inflicting substantial losses on Russian troops, claiming over 34,000 Russian personnel were killed in May alone. Ukrainian artillery, aviation, and drone systems have been targeting enemy units ""even before they reach our positions,"" he said.

While Russia's main efforts remain concentrated on the Pokrovsk, Toretsk and Lyman fronts in Donetsk Oblast, as well as in Ukraine’s northeastern Sumy Oblast bordering Russia, Zaporizhzhia has seen an uptick in escalation, Syrskyi noted.

He added that Ukrainian forces are reinforcing high-risk areas with reserves and intensifying firepower to repel attacks.

In the Sumy Oblast, Russian forces have continued cross-border raids, shelling, and attempted sabotage missions. Ukrainian officials and military analysts warn of a possible new Russian offensive targeting the region.

On May 29, State Border Guard Service spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said Russia had amassed ""sufficient forces"" in neighboring Kursk Oblast to potentially launch an incursion into Sumy.

Syrskyi also highlighted Ukrainian cross-border operations, stating that in May, Ukraine struck 58 military targets deep inside Russian territory using long-range DeepStrike systems. These included defense industry facilities producing explosive materials and combat drones.

Fighting continues on the Kursk front, where Russia has deployed elite units initially intended for operations in eastern Ukraine.

On May 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly visited Kursk Oblast after Moscow declared on April 26 that it had completed a military operation to liberate the territory from Ukrainian incursions.

NATO is not holding any active discussions on Russia's demand that the alliance halt its eastward expansion, Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty wrote, citing several undisclosed NATO officials and diplomats.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, the NATO officials said that the issue of NATO's potential non-enlargement has not been raised at any recent, or even earlier, alliance meetings. One official called it ""perhaps just an academic discussion,"" noting that any such decision would require full consensus among NATO members.

The clarification comes after Reuters reported on May 28 that Russian President Vladimir Putin's conditions for ending the war in Ukraine include receiving a written commitment from Western leaders to cease NATO's expansion.

Russian propaganda for years insisted that Ukraine's ambition to join NATO was a major trigger for its invasion. Russia's military aggression against Ukraine started in 2014 with the annexation of Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine, at a time when Ukraine's chances and desires of joining the alliance were low.

According to NATO sources cited by Radio Liberty, the written pledge Moscow demands is unrealistic. ""It’s not something they (Russia) can just get,"" one diplomat said, pointing to international agreements that enshrine every nation's right to freely choose its alliances — including the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949, the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and the 1975 Helsinki Final Act.

A separate source referenced the NATO-Russia Founding Act of 1997, a document some consider obsolete but still formally existing, which affirms respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states and upholds the principle of self-determination.

U.S. Special Envoy Keith Kellogg said in a May 29 interview with ABC News that NATO's eastward expansion is a ""fair"" concern for Putin. He also emphasized that Ukraine's membership in the alliance is ""not on the table.""

U.S. President Donald Trump has also repeatedly echoed Moscow's narrative that Ukraine's efforts to join NATO have been one of the root causes of the full-scale invasion.

In March, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha firmly opposed any limitations on Ukraine's right to join international organizations, specifically NATO and the European Union, as a condition for reaching a potential peace agreement.

The United Kingdom has labeled Russia as an ""immediate and pressing"" threat in a major strategic defense review set to be published Monday, the Guardian reported on May 31

The 130-page review, prepared by a panel of senior advisers including former NATO Secretary-General George Robertson, will reportedly highlight the ""immediate and pressing"" danger posed by Russia, drawing on lessons from its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

The analysis comes at a time of heightened concern across Europe over the potential for expanded conflict, as Russia continues its military buildup in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy Oblast and maintains strongholds across occupied Ukrainian territory.

British and French forces have already committed to leading a multinational ""reassurance force"" of up to 30,000 troops in Ukraine, should a ceasefire be reached, a prospect made uncertain by the Kremlin's continued aggression and maximalist demands.

Ukraine and Russia are expected to meet on June 2 in Istanbul after the first round of peace talks on May 16. During the first round of talks in Turkey the two sides failed to reach agreement on a 30-day ceasefire.

Ukraine had offered an immediate halt to hostilities, an all-for-all prisoner swap, and a meeting between Presidents Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin. Russia refused, instead sending a low-level delegation.

The only decision reached during the talks was an agreement on a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange.

Alongside Russia, the review identifies China as a ""sophisticated and persistent challenge,"" noting Beijing's growing ties with Moscow and its role in supplying critical components for Russian weapons systems.

Recently, Zelensky reportedly said that China stopped shipping drones to Ukraine and its European partners, while continues supplying them to Russia.

Ukrainian Foreign Intelligence Chief Oleh Ivashchenko alleged that Beijing provided special chemicals, gunpowder, and other defense-related materials to at least 20 Russian military-industrial facilities.

The British review is also expected to address the shrinking size of the British Army, which has dropped below 71,000 active-duty troops — its lowest strength since the Napoleonic era, the Guardian reported.

Peter Ricketts, a former national security adviser, said that while drones, cyber capabilities and artificial intelligence are crucial, ""another lesson of Ukraine is that mass counts, in terms of manpower and equipment.""

The report also reportedly references broader global threats posed by a ""deadly quartet"": Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, who are increasingly collaborating across multiple domains.

Authorities have ordered the mandatory evacuation of residents from 11 additional villages in Sumy Oblast due to escalating Russian attacks, Governor Oleh Hryhorov said on May 31.



Hryhorov signed the order citing the ""constant threat to civilian life"" caused by ongoing shelling in the region. The evacuation covers settlements in local communities of Sumy Oblast, which lies near the Russian border.

""(Russia) continues its terror of the borderlands, and our shared task is to save every life,"" Hryhorov said in a statement. ""I urge residents not to delay the decision to evacuate. Staying in a zone of constant danger is a direct threat to your life and health.""

With the latest order, a total of 213 settlements in Sumy Oblast are now under mandatory evacuation.

The move comes as Ukrainian officials and military analysts warn of a possible new Russian offensive targeting the region. On May 29, State Border Guard Service spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said Russia had amassed ""sufficient forces"" in neighboring Kursk Oblast to potentially launch an incursion into Sumy.

Speaking on national television, Demchenko noted that Russian troops have remained stationed in Kursk Oblast after being pushed out by Ukrainian forces during a counteroffensive in August 2024. Since then, Kyiv has observed fluctuating numbers of soldiers and equipment along the border.

""They have enough forces there (in Kursk Oblast) to carry out operations against our border and attempt to attack the territory of Ukraine,"" Demchenko said.

Russian forces recently captured four border villages, Novenke, Zhuravka, Veselivka, and Basivka, prompting further concern.

In Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said a series of strikes hit Kharkiv and nine surrounding settlements. Six people were injured. The oblast endured attacks with various weapons including 26 Shahed drones, 11 unguided rockets, and guided aerial bombs. Dozens of civilian infrastructure sites were reportedly damaged or destroyed.

In Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported three people were killed and 10 others injured as Russia targeted more than 30 towns and villages with drones, artillery, and airstrikes. Critical and residential infrastructure was hit, including a private house, gas pipeline, garages, and vehicles.

In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Governor Ivan Fedorov said one child was killed and another injured in Dolynka village. Russian forces launched 628 strikes across 24 settlements, including 40 airstrikes, 376 drone attacks (mostly FPV), and 205 artillery strikes.

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Governor Serhii Lysak said two people were injured in attacks on the Nikopol area, including the city itself and the surrounding communities. Artillery, FPV drones, and drone-dropped munitions were used.

The attack occurred in the frontline village of Dolynka in the Polohivskyi district, Fedorov said.

Russia has regularly targeted civilian infrastructure in aerial attacks against Ukraine since the start of its full-scale war in February 2022.

Moscow has intensified drone and missile attacks against Ukraine despite peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow in Istanbul on May 16.

The talks in Turkey were largely inconclusive. Russia reiterated maximalist demands that Ukraine hand over Crimea and eastern oblasts.

The two sides were able to agree to a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange, which was carried out between May 23 and 25.

Russian President Vladimir Putin refused President Volodymyr Zelensky's invitation to meet face-to-face in Istanbul. Instead, Russia sent a delegation of lower-level officials led by Putin's aide, Vladimir Medinsky.

Russia has refused a ceasefire and instead insisted it would provide Ukraine with a peace memorandum shortly after the May 16 talks. Ukraine and Russia are slated to hold another round of peace talks on June 2.

Ukraine will skip a $665 million government debt payment after failing to agree on restructuring terms with creditors, Bloomberg reported on May 30.

""Ukraine remains committed to implementing a comprehensive, fair and equitable restructuring of the GDP-linked securities,"" the Finance Ministry told Bloomberg.

On April 24, the Ukrainian government said it failed to reach an agreement with its debtholders to restructure approximately $2.6 billion of debt. This indicated Kyiv could default on its latest payment.

The debt consists of so-called GDP warrants, a financial instrument that gives the debtholder the right to additional payments based on economic performance.

Ukraine has said it will seek to abide by its agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and official partners, Bloomberg reported.

The IMF has warned that failure to resolve the GDP warrant issue could threaten further debt restructuring, as well as an ongoing $15.6 billion bailout program, the Extended Fund Facility (EFF).

Kyiv reached an agreement with some of its creditors in July 2024 to restructure more than $20 billion in international bonds, allowing Ukraine to avoid default amid Russia's full-scale war.

In September, the Finance Ministry announced it had reduced state debt by $9 billion after completing an external debt restructuring process.

Ukraine's economy has struggled in the face of Russia's war. Its GDP fell drastically in the early days of Russia's full-scale invasion and has steadily grown since.

Ukraine and Russia held a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange from May 23 to 25 after previously agreeing to the exchange at peace talks on May 16. Aside from yielding a prisoner exchange, the peace negotiations in Istanbul were largely inconclusive.

The majority of those exchanged were prisoners of war in Russia's war against Ukraine. 880 of 1,000 were military personnel. 120 of those returned were civilians held in Russian captivity, 65 of whom were set to be deported to Ukraine regardless of the prisoner exchange.

15 of the prisoners were serving sentences. Meanwhile, 50 of the exchanged prisoners were indefinitely held in detention facilities for foreigners not permitted to stay in Russia, awaiting deportation to Ukraine, Suspilne reported.

While in captivity, the prisoners were offered freedom and Russian citizenship if they fought on behalf of Russia in its war against Ukraine.

""We were lucky. But it would have been better if the guys who fought had been given up instead of us,"" one of the released prisoners said.

Many of the released prisoners were returned to Ukraine without their legal documents, including passports.

Claims of Russian President Vladimir Putin's helicopter being ""at the epicenter"" of a Ukrainian drone attack in Kursk Oblast were reportedly fabricated by the Kremlin, the Moscow Times reported on May 30, citing four Russian government sources.

A Russian military commander claimed on May 20 that Putin's helicopter was subject to a Ukrainian drone attack in Russia's Kursk Oblast, as Putin made his first known visit to the region since Moscow claimed its recapture.

""We were simultaneously engaged in an air defense battle and ensuring airspace security for the president’s helicopter flight,"" Yury Dashkin, commander of an air defense division, said, as cited by the Russian news agency RBC on May 25. ""The helicopter was effectively at the epicenter of the response to the massive drone attack.""

Multiple sources in the Kremlin told the Moscow Times that Russia's Defense Ministry had disseminated the story to Russian-state media as a means to make Putin appear as though he ""shares the danger"" of the war, in an attempt to garner support for the Russian president by painting him as more closely involved in the fighting.

Despite the claims, Putin's visit to Kursk Oblast was conducted in secrecy, with Russian-state media reporting on the trip after it had concluded, according to the Moscow Times.

""President Putin himself is suffering, struggling, and even risking his own life. Your problems are trivial. You must grit your teeth and endure,"" a government official told the Moscow Times, in describing the Kremlin's motivation behind the staging.

The reportedly fabricated story comes as Kyiv has ramped up its attack on Moscow, launching hundreds of Ukrainian kamikaze drones towards the Russian capital. While none have appeared to have reached Moscow, the attacks have caused significant disruptions to commuter air traffic.

Ukrainian drones have forced at least 218 temporary airport closures across Russia since Jan. 1, independent Russian outlet Novaya Gazeta Europe reported on May 14, citing data from Russia's state aviation agency Rosaviatsia.

During his visit to Kursk, Putin met with Acting Governor Alexander Khinshtein, heads of local municipalities, and members of volunteer organizations. He also visited the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, the Kremlin's press service said. The exact date of the visit was not revealed at the time of publication.

Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign forces since World War II. The operation aimed to disrupt a planned Russian offensive on the neighboring Sumy Oblast and draw Russian forces away from the embattled Donetsk Oblast.

""All of a sudden rockets got shot into a couple of cities and people died. I saw thing I was surprised at and I don't like being surprised, so I'm very disappointed in that way,"" Trump added.

For three consecutive days over May 24-26, Russia launched a series of mass drone and missile attacks at Ukrainian cities, during which more than 600 drones and dozens of missiles were launched in one of the heaviest attacks of the war to date.

On May 26, Russia carried out the largest drone attack of the full-scale war, which reportedly involved 355 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys.

Trump said he disapproved of Russia's recent missile attacks on Ukrainian cities during ongoing diplomatic efforts.

""I don't know what the hell happened to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, I've known him for a long time,"" Trump said on May 25 amid the onslaught of attacks. ""He's killing a lot of people.""

Despite the barrage of attacks and Russia's ongoing rejection of a 30-day ceasefire, Trump on May 28 said that ""it'll take about two weeks, or week and a half,"" to determine if Putin serious about ending war.

A day earlier on May 27, Trump admitted that Russia would already be facing serious consequences, including sanctions, if not for his actions.

""What Vladimir Putin doesn't realize is that if it weren't for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean really bad. He's playing with fire,"" he wrote on Truth Social.

Despite repeatedly threatening additional sanctions against Moscow, Trump has thus far refused to implement a proposed sanctions package.

""If I think I'm close to getting a deal, I don't want to screw it up by doing that,"" Trump told reporters on May 28.

Despite the delays, key Trump ally and Republican Senator, Lindsey Graham, said at a press briefing in Kyiv on May 30 that the U.S. Senate is expected to ""start moving"" next week on a bill introducing sweeping new sanctions against Russia

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on May 29 that Trump hopes that the forthcoming peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia will ""move the ball forward"" on his efforts to broker a peace deal.

Ukraine's rocky relationship with Hungary reached new lows this month with the uncovering of an alleged spy ring run from Budapest.

Arrests, tit-for-tat expulsions, and a stream of accusations from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban soon followed in a diplomatic scandal with potentially massive ramifications for both countries.

""This is probably the most-discussed Ukraine-related news (in Hungary) since the beginning of the full-scale invasion,"" Andras Racz, a senior fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP) Center for Security and Defense, told the Kyiv Independent.

""It's truly unprecedented,"" he added.

Adding to the intrigue are the questions looming over the motives of the alleged spies, who were allegedly tasked with gathering sensitive military information that would be highly valuable to one country in particular — Russia.

What happened?

Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) on May 9 said it had uncovered a Hungarian espionage network in western Ukraine in what was the first case of its kind.

SBU counterintelligence detained two alleged agents and identified their supervisor as a Hungarian military intelligence officer.

According to the SBU, one of those detained is a 40-year-old former Ukrainian military officer who was recruited by Hungarian intelligence in 2021 and placed in standby mode.



Kyiv has long accused Budapest of undermining Ukraine's sovereignty through political interference and pursuing an active policy of issuing Hungarian passports to ethnic Hungarians in the region.

They claim he was ""activated"" in September 2024 when he began to conduct reconnaissance on the deployment of Ukrainian Armed Forces and the coordinates of S-300 air defense systems in the region.

The spies’ tasks also included identifying official vehicles belonging to Ukraine's army, and gathering data on the presence of aircraft and helicopters in Zakarpattia Oblast.

They were also tasked with gauging local attitudes to various scenarios including the deployment of a Hungarian ""peacekeeping contingent.""

Why is Hungary interested in Zakarpattia Oblast?

At the center of the spy scandal is Ukraine's Zakarpattia Oblast, a region that has long been home to a large ethnic Hungarian minority that numbered 70,000-80,000 in 2024.

Relations between Ukraine and Hungary have been historically strained because of issues relating to Zakarpattia Oblast — Kyiv has long accused Budapest of undermining Ukraine's sovereignty through political interference and pursuing an active policy of issuing Hungarian passports to ethnic Hungarians in the region.

In turn, Budapest accuses Kyiv of discriminating against the Hungarian ethnic minority there, especially over Ukraine's language laws that require at least 70% of education above fifth grade to be conducted in Ukrainian.

A map showing Ukraine's Zakarpattia Oblast (The Kyiv Independent / Nizar al-Rifai)

While Budapest has called this measure discriminatory toward the Hungarian minority, Kyiv denies it is discriminatory, saying it only aims to ensure that every Ukrainian citizen has sufficient knowledge of the country's official language.

These issues have taken on extra significance since the start of Ukraine's accession talks which formally launched in June 2024. Hungary — which as an existing member of the EU holds veto power over accession decisions — has held up the process, citing discrimination against its Hungarian minority as a key obstacle.

What has Hungary said about the spying scandal?

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has accused Ukraine of collaborating with his political opposition, Tisza party leader Peter Magyar, to orchestrate a campaign to discredit him ahead of a planned referendum on Kyiv's EU membership.

The day before the SBU announcement, Magyar released an audio recording of a 2023 conversation in which Defense Minister Kristof Szalay-Bobrovniczky talks of preparing the country's military for war — the opposite of what he and Orban had been saying in public, Magyar said.

""Thus, the Hungarian opposition party took an active part in the special operation of the Ukrainian secret service,"" Orban said on May 13, adding: ""Such a thing has never happened in our memory.""

Budapest also on May 9 expelled what it claimed were two ""spies"" working under diplomatic cover at Ukraine's embassy in Budapest, a move met with reciprocal expulsions by Kyiv.

Another two Ukrainian ""spies"" were allegedly uncovered on May 20.

After the scandal, Hungarian Deputy Foreign Minister Levente Magyar refused to come to Ukraine on May 12 for planned talks about the Hungarian national minority, Ukraine’s Justice Ministry said on May 11.

How did Ukraine react?

According to Racz, just the fact that Ukraine's SBU went public with the information is in itself significant.

""Usually, espionage-related affairs are handled in a silent, non-public way. Even if there are expulsions, usually both sides are interested in minimizing tensions and the damage inflicted,"" Racz said.



""Why would Budapest need the location and exact type of the air defense systems so much that they specifically instructed one of the agents to go there and take pictures of the installations? [...] I find no other plausible answer than Russia.""

And the timing of the announcement may also have been deliberate — according to Viktor Yahun, former deputy head of the SBU, the release of the information on May 9, Russia’s Victory Day, was to ""show once again how close the contacts and intentions of Hungary and Russia are.""

Orban’s Russia connection

Complicating matters further is the fact that Orban is widely seen as the EU's most pro-Russian leader, and has repeatedly opposed military aid for Ukraine, arguing that Western support prolongs the war.

He has maintained close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, holding official meetings despite the full-scale invasion and amplified Kremlin narratives in Europe.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has visited Russia 13 times in the past three years, far more than any other EU diplomat, and even more than some of Russia’s closest allies.

Largely because of this, Hungary has shifted into a ""gray zone"" regarding intelligence sharing with EU countries, Vitalii Diachuk, the Institute for Central European Strategy (ICES) analyst, told the Kyiv Independent.

The intelligence exchange process became more formalized, and Hungary ceased receiving analytical intelligence from NATO and EU countries, and stopped providing any of its own intelligence related to Russia, he added.

Diachuk said there was nothing irregular about a country collecting general intelligence on its neighbors ""especially when there is a war going on,"" but said a line would be crossed if that information ""poses a threat to Ukraine's national security.""

The SBU's claim that Hungarian spies were collecting information about Ukraine's air defenses would most certainly cross this line, Racz said

""If the SBU's claims are well-grounded… then it is very hard to imagine why this information would be relevant for Hungary,"" he added.

""Why would Budapest need the location and exact type of the air defense systems so much that they specifically instructed one of the agents to go there and take pictures of the installations?""

Given the highly unlikely scenario that Hungary is planning to attack Ukraine and thus needs to know where its air defenses are located, the remaining possible explanations are limited.

""At present, unfortunately, I find no other plausible answer than Russia,"" Racz said.

Yahun told the Kyiv Independent that it's within the realm of possibility that Orban was acting under the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""Some of my colleagues have said that it is possible that during Orban's meeting with Putin (in July 2024), he could have persuaded Orban to exchange some intelligence information that is sensitive to Hungary and Russia,"" Yahun said.

Yahun also said it's unlikely that Orban didn't know about the spying operation given his closeness to Major General Norbert Tajti, the head of Hungary's Military National Security Service (KNBSZ).

Before his appointment, he served in Hungary’s Joint Forces Command and as Orban’s aide in the Prime Minister’s Office.

""(Tajti) had been a personal assistant to Orban for three years. This means that this person is completely devoted to Orban, and any actions on his part could not have been operated independently,"" Yahun said.

Racz also said that Orban's explanation — that the entire thing was an orchestrated campaign between Ukraine and his political opposition — is unlikely as Orban would not have missed the opportunity to present solid evidence and ""frame Peter Magyar's Tisza party as a Ukrainian agent.""

The Kyiv Independent contacted the SBU to ask how long the alleged Hungarian spying operation had been ongoing, and if it was broader than just the two individuals already detained.

""All information about the investigation that is currently permitted to be made public has already been posted on the official resources of the (SBU),"" it said in a written statement.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2159703245.jpg

President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke by phone with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on May 30 to discuss the next round of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, tentatively scheduled for June 2 in Istanbul.

""We both agree that such a meeting cannot and should not be empty,"" Zelensky said on social media following the call. ""There must be a ceasefire to move further toward peace. The killings must stop.""

The phone call comes just days ahead of the proposed meeting, the second such round of direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow since 2022. The first session, held in Istanbul on May 16, ended without an agreement on a ceasefire but led to the largest prisoner exchange of the war.

""The exchange of prisoners was an important achievement of that meeting, but unfortunately, it was the only one,"" Zelensky said, referring to the first round of talks.

During the call the leaders also discussed the possibility of four-way peace talks that include Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, and the United States.

Earlier in the day on May 30, Zelensky expressed skepticism that the next round of talks will produce any results due to what he described as Moscow's deliberate inaction.

Zelensky's Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said on May 29 that Kyiv is open to the talks but insists that Russia share their ceasefire memorandum ahead of the meeting.

""For the meeting to be meaningful, it is necessary to understand its agenda and prepare properly for the negotiations. Unfortunately, Russia is doing everything it can to ensure that the next possible meeting is fruitless,"" Zelensky said earlier in the day.

Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on May 28 that Ukraine has already shared its own memorandum, which includes a full ceasefire on land, in the air, and at sea, to be monitored by international partners, according to the New York Times.

Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya on May 30 reiterated that Moscow would only consider a ceasefire if Ukraine halts mobilization and stops receiving foreign military aid.

Despite the standoff, in a separate readout of the call, the Turkish Presidential office called on talks to resume ""without any further delay.""

""Stating that discussing the potential ceasefire in the second round of the talks planned to be held in Istanbul will pave the way for peace,"" the statement from Erdogan's office read.

Reuters reported that President Vladimir Putin's broader demands include a written pledge from NATO to stop expanding, the lifting of certain sanctions, and recognition of Ukraine's neutral status.

U.S. President Donald Trump has decided to appoint the next Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), reaffirming a key American role in NATO's military structure, Reuters reported on May 30, citing unnamed officials.

The decision marks a reversal of earlier speculation that the Trump administration was considering relinquishing the U.S. military position, traditionally held by an American four-star general for nearly 75 years.

According to Reuters, Trump personally informed NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte of the decision, with an official announcement expected in the coming days.

The leading candidate is reportedly U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Alexus Grynkewich, who currently serves as Director for Operations of the Joint Staff.

The position, currently held by Army General Christopher Cavoli since July 2022, oversees all NATO operations in Europe and is considered one of the alliance's most critical posts. The U.S. has filled the role since its creation after World War II.

The move is likely to offer short-term reassurance to NATO allies wary of a potential American drawdown. Trump's ""America First"" doctrine has repeatedly cast doubt on the U.S. commitment to multilateral alliances, especially NATO.

In recent years, he has questioned whether Washington should defend alliance members that do not meet military spending benchmarks. The comment sparked alarm across Europe, where several countries, including Italy, Canada, and Spain, still fall short of the 2% of GDP goal.

Some NATO members are now reportedly considering raising the threshold to 3% of GDP by 2030.

The decision to name a new SACEUR suggests the U.S. will remain engaged in the alliance's military command structure for now, even as Trump continues to push for a rebalancing of defense responsibilities among NATO members.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-996942026-1.jpg

Key developments on May 28:

Ukraine attacks elite Russian unit base nearly 7,000km away in Vladivostok, source claims

Ukraine ready for 2nd round of Istanbul talks but seeks Russian draft memo in advance, Yermak says

Senate to 'start moving' Russia sanctions bill next week, Graham says

Russia may 'consider' ceasefire if Ukraine stops mobilization, arms deliveries, ambassador says

Putin in favor of meeting Zelensky, Trump if progress is made in peace talks, Kremlin says

Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) was behind explosions near Desantnaya Bay in Russia's Vladivostok on May 30, which reportedly damaged military personnel and equipment, a source in HUR told the Kyiv Independent.

If confirmed, the Vladivostok operation would be Ukraine's furthest incursion into Russian territory - approximately 6,800 kilometres from the Ukrainian border.

According to the source, two blasts occurred early in the morning at a site where Russia's 47th Separate Air Assault Battalion of the 155th Separate Guards Marine Brigade was stationed.

The 155th Marine Brigade has been actively involved in the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including battles in Mariupol and Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, as well as operations in Russia's Kursk Oblast.

Local media reported two loud bangs, followed by temporary road closures and emergency vehicles seen in the area, but did not mention anything about a military base.

Russia's Anti-Terrorist Commission of Primorsky Krai attributed the explosions to the ignition of propane-butane cylinders inside a vehicle. No official casualties have been reported.

One of the explosions allegedly happened near a checkpoint, while the other hit the location of personnel and the unit's command.

""Manpower, military equipment, and special equipment were hit,"" the source claimed.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims.

Desantnaya Bay is located in Vladivostok in Russia's Far East, which lies some 185 kilometres (114 miles) from the Russian-North Korean border.

Ukraine ready for 2nd round of Istanbul talks but seeks Russian draft memo in advance, Yermak says

Ukraine is ready to attend the second round of peace talks with the Russian delegation in Istanbul on June 2, but seeks to receive a draft of Russia’s proposed ceasefire memorandum before the meeting, said Presidential Office Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak on May 29.

Ukraine and Russia held peace talks in Istanbul on May 16, where both sides agreed to a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange. The peace negotiations were largely inconclusive, with Moscow reiterating maximalist demands and sending a delegation of lower-level officials.

Moscow has proposed June 2 as the date for the next round of talks with Ukraine, despite escalating its attacks on the country.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on May 29 that the Russian delegation, led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, is prepared to present the memorandum to the Ukrainian side and provide necessary clarifications during the next Istanbul meeting.

Kyiv insists on receiving the memorandum ahead of the new round of talks in order to understand Russia’s proposed steps toward a ceasefire. Ukraine has already submitted its own document to the Russian side.

""Ukraine is ready to attend the next meeting, but we want to engage in a constructive discussion. This means it is important to receive Russia’s draft. There is enough time – four days are sufficient for preparing and sending the documents,"" Yermak said during a conversation with advisors to the leaders of the U.K., Germany, France, and Italy.

Security advisors from the four countries are expected to attend the second round of peace talks in Istanbul, U.S. President Donald Trump's Special Envoy Keith Kellogg said.

Senate to 'start moving' Russia sanctions bill next week, Graham says

The U.S. Senate is expected to ""start moving"" next week on a bill introducing sweeping new sanctions against Russia, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said at a press briefing in Kyiv on May 30 attended by The Kyiv Independent.

The proposed bill would impose 500% tariffs on imports from countries purchasing Russian oil, gas, uranium, and other products. At least 82 U.S. senators are prepared to vote for the bill, Graham said.

""I would expect next week that the Senate will start moving the sanctions bill,"" Graham, a vocal supporter of Ukraine and close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, said. ""There are House members that are ready to move in the House, and you'll see congressional action. President Trump said that the next two-week period will be outcome-determined.""

Asked whether Congress would pass the bill before its summer recess and whether Trump would sign it, Graham responded: ""I've never been more optimistic than I am today.""

The senator dismissed the upcoming June 2 Russian-Ukrainian peace talks in Istanbul, where Moscow is expected to present a draft ceasefire memorandum, as unlikely to yield progress.

""I see nothing about the meeting on Monday in Istanbul to give me any hope at all that Russia is interested in peace,"" he said. ""So when this two-week period is over, I think it'd be pretty clear to everybody (that) Russia is playing a game at the expense of the world, not just the United States.""

The senator also credited growing global recognition of Ukraine's willingness to negotiate in good faith and Russia's refusal to reciprocate.

""It's clear to almost anyone — Putin is not remotely interested in anything that would lead to peace,"" he said. ""So there's a card game going on this summer. The first cards are going to be played by the United States Senate and the House.""

Graham accused Moscow of stalling while ramping up its war effort and warned that the U.S. response would be swift and severe. He also issued a stark warning to Beijing.

""China, the game you're playing with Russia is about to change. If you keep buying cheap Russian oil to fuel Putin's war machine, there will be a 500% tariff on all of your products coming into the United States,"" he said.

He added that ""70% of Russian oil is bought by China and India.""

Russia may 'consider' ceasefire if Ukraine stops mobilization, arms deliveries, ambassador says

Russia is prepared to consider a ceasefire in its war against Ukraine, but only if Kyiv stops receiving Western weapons and halts mobilization, Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's envoy to the United Nations, said on May 30, according to the Russian state news agency TASS.

""In principle, we are ready to consider the possibility of establishing a ceasefire, which would subsequently allow for a sustainable resolution of the root causes of the conflict,"" Nebenzya said at a U.N. Security Council meeting.

Russia, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, convened the meeting to accuse European nations of undermining peace efforts. The Russian ambassador said that any ceasefire would require Western governments to end their support for Ukraine's armed forces.

""During the ceasefire, it is essential that Western countries stop supplying weapons to the Kyiv regime (the Ukrainian government) and that Ukraine halt its mobilization,"" Nebenzya said.

The statement comes just days ahead of the next round of peace talks in Istanbul on June 2. Despite the stated offer, Nebenzya also pledged that Moscow would ""continue and intensify military operations for as long as necessary.""

Ukraine swiftly rejected the demand as disingenuous.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha called the remarks a ""slap in the face to all who advocate for peace,"" including countries like China and Brazil, which have pressed both sides to end the war.

""When the entire world insists that it is time to stop the killing immediately and engage in meaningful diplomacy, Russia uses the highest fora to spew such belligerent rhetoric,"" Sybiha wrote on X.

""We insist that the pressure on Moscow be increased already now. They do not understand normal attitude or diplomatic language; it is time to speak to them in the language of sanctions and increased support for Ukraine.""

Despite growing global calls for a truce, Russia has so far rejected Ukraine's U.S.-backed proposal for a full and unconditional ceasefire. The Kremlin has instead escalated its aerial assaults across Ukrainian territory and is reportedly preparing a new summer offensive.

Putin in favor of meeting Zelensky, Trump if progress is made in peace talks, Kremlin says

Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""fundamentally in favor"" of meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on May 30, according to Russian state news agency TASS.

The statement comes amid renewed diplomatic maneuvering to schedule the next round of peace talks in Istanbul, tentatively proposed for June 2.

Peskov stressed that a high-level summit would require concrete outcomes from the negotiations between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations.

""President Putin has repeatedly said that he is fundamentally in favor of high-level contacts, which are undoubtedly needed,"" Peskov said. ""But they must be prepared, and first, a result must be achieved in negotiations between the delegations.""

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said on May 30 that Turkey would be open to hosting a possible meeting among the three leaders, with the participation of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as well. Fidan's statement followed his visits to both Kyiv and Moscow.

Zelensky previously invited Putin to Istanbul for direct talks on May 16, proposing a three-way format with Trump to push forward peace efforts. Putin declined to attend, sending a low-level delegation led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.

The Istanbul talks ended without agreement on a ceasefire or broader political settlement, though the sides did agree to the largest prisoner exchange of the full-scale war.

The Kremlin has repeatedly attacked Zelensky's legitimacy as president, pointing out that his first presidential term was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024.

Ukraine's constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia's full-scale invasion began in 2022. As a result, Zelensky's term has been extended, which constitutional lawyers argue is permitted under Ukrainian law.

Trump, who held a two-hour phone call with Putin on May 19 and is pushing to broker a ceasefire deal, has backed the idea of a high-level summit. Putin and Zelensky have met only once — in December 2019, during the Normandy Format talks in Paris.

Benchmarks and soft commitments with the IMF

Ukraine approves roadmap for customs reform planning amid implementation deadlock

Ukraine’s Cabinet of Ministers, following a proposal by the Finance Ministry, has approved the development of a medium-term action plan for customs reform implementation under the National Revenue Strategy through 2030.

The move comes despite mounting criticism from civil society and lawmakers that the government has deliberately stalled customs reform for over five months — specifically by failing to form the selection commission required by law and the International Monetary Fund’s financial support program to reboot the State Customs Service.

Zelensky submits bill to establish two specialized administrative courts in Kyiv

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has submitted draft law #13302 to parliament, proposing the creation of a Specialized District Administrative Court and a Specialized Administrative Court of Appeal, both to be headquartered in Kyiv with nationwide jurisdiction.

Parliament is set to vote for the draft law in the first reading during the next plenary meetings scheduled for June 3-5.

According to the explanatory note, the bill has been prepared to implement the legal framework for launching the two new courts. The proposal follows prior approval by the High Council of Justice, which endorsed the president’s initiative to formally establish the courts and begin operational planning.

The courts are expected to play a central role in handling public administration and anti-corruption cases, including high-profile disputes involving state institutions.

Obligations to the EU



Ukrainian parliament to review bills linked to Ukraine Facility in early June

The Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's Parliament, is scheduled to hold its next plenary sessions from June 3–6, with a legislative agenda that includes several bills tied to the country’s commitments under the EU-backed Ukraine Facility program.

Among the priority bills:

draft law #13165 and alternatives on improving judicial integrity declarations (first reading);

and alternatives on improving judicial integrity declarations (first reading); draft law #12377 on establishing the fundamentals of national housing policy (first reading);

on establishing the fundamentals of national housing policy (first reading); draft law #9363 on the digitalization of enforcement proceedings (repeated second reading);

on the digitalization of enforcement proceedings (repeated second reading); draft law #12374-d on the restart and strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA) (second reading).

In addition, lawmakers are expected to consider in second reading draft law #13018-d on financial inclusion, which would allow the establishment of banking services via Ukrposhta. While not a binding obligation, the legislation is part of Ukraine’s soft commitments under its IMF memorandum.

Other key economic issues

""During the ceasefire, it is essential that Western countries stop supplying weapons to the Kyiv regime (the Ukrainian government) and that Ukraine halt its mobilization,"" Nebenzya said.

The statement comes just days ahead of the next round of peace talks in Istanbul on June 2. Despite the stated offer, Nebenzya also pledged that Moscow would ""continue and intensify military operations for as long as necessary.""

Ukraine swiftly rejected the demand as disingenuous.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha called the remarks a ""slap in the face to all who advocate for peace,"" including countries like China and Brazil, which have pressed both sides to end the war.

""When the entire world insists that it is time to stop the killing immediately and engage in meaningful diplomacy, Russia uses the highest fora to spew such belligerent rhetoric,"" Sybiha wrote on X.

""We insist that the pressure on Moscow be increased already now. They do not understand normal attitude or diplomatic language; it is time to speak to them in the language of sanctions and increased support for Ukraine.""

Despite growing global calls for a truce, Russia has so far rejected Ukraine's U.S.-backed proposal for a full and unconditional ceasefire. The Kremlin has instead escalated its aerial assaults across Ukrainian territory and is reportedly preparing a new summer offensive.

Moscow is expected to present a draft ""ceasefire memorandum"" at the June 2 talks in Istanbul. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on May 29 that the proposal would be delivered by Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky, who led Russia's delegation at the previous round of talks.

President Volodymyr Zelensky's Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said on May 29 that Kyiv is open to the talks but insists that Russia share the memorandum ahead of the meeting.

Poland’s presidential race has never seen a first-round winner with so many reasons to worry, the far right so emboldened, and Ukraine so central to the campaign.

The June 1 run-off between Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski of the ruling Civic Platform (PO) and Karol Nawrocki, backed by Law and Justice (PiS), will likely reshape not only Poland’s domestic political balance but also its approach to Ukraine. And the clash will be tight: in a first-round that saw a record 67.3% turnout, Trzaskowski secured 31.4% of the vote and Nawrocki 29.5%.

Following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Poland emerged as one of Kyiv’s staunchest allies – sending weapons, sheltering millions of refugees, and rallying Western support. But over time, political tensions, economic fatigue, and disputes over grain imports and historical memory have strained the relationship.

""These elections are crucial to Ukraine because they will either end the electoral cycle in Poland or open a new one,” Ukrainian political analyst Yevhen Mahda told the Kyiv Independent. “And amid global turmoil, we need a stable, friendly Poland.""

The first-round results have been described as a ""yellow card"" for the ruling coalition that has governed Poland since 2023 under Prime Minister Donald Tusk. If outgoing President Andrzej Duda is succeeded by Nawrocki, whom he endorsed, Civic Platform will face regular obstruction through presidential vetoes.

Although the Polish president holds limited executive power, he plays a key role in foreign affairs and serves as commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Polish presidents have historically been particularly active in shaping eastern policy.

""The past three years have shown that it is politicians who set the temperature of relations between our nations,"" said Zbigniew Parafianowicz, a journalist and author of ""Poland at War,"" which examines Polish-Ukrainian policy at the outset of Russia’s invasion.

""Neither candidate will work wonders for Ukraine, but Kyiv has good reason to pay close attention.""

Right-wing drift

Traditionally divided between the pro-European liberal PO and the conservative nationalist PiS, Poland’s political scene has long been vulnerable to populist and anti-establishment forces. This time, it was the far right that surged to unprecedented strength and could now determine the outcome.

Slawomir Mentzen, of the economically libertarian and socially conservative Confederation Party, came third with 14.8% of the vote. Although left-wing candidates Adrian Zandberg, Magdalena Biejat, and Joanna Senyszyn received a combined 10.2%, Mentzen is now widely seen as the election’s kingmaker.

In a bid to win over Mentzen’s electorate, both candidates agreed to be interviewed on his YouTube channel, and Nawrocki signed a list of demands he put forward. Hoping to capture some of those votes, Trzaskowski made a surprise visit to his pub, where they shared a beer.

""Pro-Russian narratives don’t sell here, but anti-Ukrainian (ones) do.""

Trzaskowski — a pro-European polyglot, son of a jazz musician, and senior figure in the Polish liberal establishment — faces a delicate balancing act: maintaining support from the center-left while reaching out to mostly young radical voters drawn to the Confederation. He has twice won the mayoral election in Warsaw but lost the presidential race in 2020 to Duda by just 2%, or 422,000 votes.

Mentzen has repeatedly criticized Poland’s support for Ukraine, opposing military aid and refugee assistance while promoting a nationalist narrative that frames Ukrainians as economic and cultural threats. He conditioned his sympathies in the second round on a promise not to send Polish troops to Ukraine and to oppose Ukraine’s NATO membership.

""There’s a rise in anti-Ukrainian sentiment — not just on the far right, but also in the mainstream electorate,"" said political analyst and president of the Batory Foundation Edwin Bendyk. ""It’s driven by societal fatigue with the war next door, housing competition in big cities, and communication failures on both sides. Pro-Russian narratives don’t sell here, but anti-Ukrainian (ones) do.""

It remains so despite positive developments such as the resumption of the long-stalled exhumation process of victims of the Volyn Massacre in the Ukrainian village of Puznyky, marking a symbolic step forward in addressing painful chapters of shared history, or Poland’s continued support of Kyiv’s defense needs and arms transit.

Another far-right fringe politician, Grzegorz Braun who campaigned against what he called the ""Ukrainization"" of Poland, came fourth with 6.3% of the vote. The man who had earlier caused an international scandal by putting out Hanukkah candles with a fire extinguisher in the Polish Parliament, tore down a Ukrainian flag from the town hall in Bielsko-Biala during the campaign.

‘Nawrocki is no Duda’

Nawrocki, previously a little-known director of the Institute of National Remembrance, openly embraced much of the far right’s platform during the campaign. He pledged to lower taxes, reject what he called the EU’s ""sick"" climate policies, and end what he described as Ukraine’s ""indecent"" treatment of Poland. He is officially not a member of PiS and positions himself as an independent candidate, not responsible for the policies of the party led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski.

""Nawrocki is no Duda,"" said Bendyk. ""He’s a nationalist, not a conservative. His victory would likely slow Ukraine’s integration with the West."" Parafianowicz, in turn, called Nawrocki — who briefly met with Donald Trump during a U.S. visit — a ""Trumpian politician"" who will likely try to align with the former president’s agenda. In a move unprecedented for the U.S., Trump sent his Director of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to support Nawrocki in the final days of the race.

""If the most pro-Ukrainian candidate calls Ukraine a 'buffer zone,' that’s a clear sign something has gone wrong.""

There have been ups and downs in Polish-Ukrainian relations since the start of the full-scale invasion – from the emotional embraces between Duda and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to mutual accusations and perceived insults. While the PiS-PO rivalry dominates Poland’s brutal election campaign, it has no obvious impact on Ukraine policy — but that doesn’t mean Kyiv isn’t watching closely.

""If the most pro-Ukrainian candidate calls Ukraine a 'buffer zone,' that’s a clear sign something has gone wrong,"" Ukrainian historian and publicist Wasyl Rasevych told the Kyiv Independent, referring to a term Trzaskowski used repeatedly during the campaign.

""Russian propaganda undermines EU unity and spreads instability in countries aiding Ukraine, and Poland may unwittingly be playing into that scenario,"" he added.

Ahead of the vote, Polish authorities uncovered a foreign-funded disinformation campaign on Facebook and cyberattacks targeting government parties. Officials suspect Russia, which is also blamed for a 2024 arson attack on Warsaw’s Marywilska shopping center, viewing it as part of a wider hybrid warfare strategy to destabilize Ukraine’s allies.

While Russian meddling is real, some argue its impact is overstated. ""We’ve inflated the idea of ‘Russian influence’ so much,"" said Parafianowicz, ""that we’ve lost sight of proportion."" The true sources of discontent, he argues, lie in domestic politics on both sides of the border.

Disappointed allies

According to Parafianowicz, Polish political elites' disappointment with Zelensky is ""an open secret."" He cites the Ukrainian president’s refusal to acknowledge that the missile that killed two Poles in Przewodow was Ukrainian and his remarks about Poland at the UN in 2023, as examples of what he sees as a growing disregard for Warsaw’s leadership.

""Ukraine would welcome a winner who truly pursues deeper cooperation with the EU and Germany.""

Despite these frictions, Poland and Ukraine remain strategic allies. Both Trzaskowski and Nawrocki have pledged to increase defense spending, strengthen the Polish military, maintain a hardline stance on the Belarusian border, and continue supporting Ukraine militarily.

But the key difference lies in their vision of international alliances — and their willingness to sideline Ukraine’s interests.

""The Polish right is afraid of Ukrainian economic competition and Kyiv’s political alignment with Berlin,"" said Rasevych. ""Ukraine would welcome a winner who truly pursues deeper cooperation with the EU and Germany.""

Trzaskowski appears to offer that option and promises to gain more leverage in the EU, together with heavyweight politicians such as Tusk or Polish hawkish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski. But with traditional alliances shaken by unpredictable Trump, no one can foresee which cards will turn out lucky.

""The idea that Poles and Ukrainians truly understand each other is a dangerous myth,"" Mahda said. ""Ukraine needs both a Plan A and a Plan B — prepared for either Trzaskowski or Nawrocki, while staying focused on real issues in defense, energy, and the economy.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2214755896.jpg

Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers has approved a one-time payment of Hr 200,000 ($4,800) for medical school graduates who accept positions at health care facilities in rural areas or active combat zones, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on May 30, according to the Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform.

The new measure, set to take effect in 2025, is aimed at addressing critical staffing shortages in front-line and underserved regions from which many residents — and professionals — have fled due to ongoing Russian attacks.

""Along with security and defense, investment in human capital is a cross-cutting policy of the government and the state,"" Shmyhal said. ""This is effective support for young specialists and a means of overcoming the shortage of medical personnel in the regions.""

Ukraine has faced growing difficulties maintaining access to essential services in embattled territories, with hospitals and clinics particularly affected by Russia's war.

Taras Melnychuk, the Cabinet's representative in parliament, said the bonus will be available to interns beginning in 2025.

To qualify, candidates must complete training in a medical specialty and sign a contract for at least three years with a state or municipal health care facility located either in a rural area or in an active combat zone.

They must also apply for a vacancy listed at the time of submission via the Unified Job Portal and be employed at a facility where staffing in medical positions does not exceed 75%.

Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) was behind explosions near Desantnaya Bay in Russia's Vladivostok on May 30, which reportedly damaged military personnel and equipment, a source in HUR told the Kyiv Independent.

If confirmed, the Vladivostok operation would be Ukraine's furthest incursion into Russian territory - approximately 6,800 kilometres from the Ukrainian border.

According to the source, two blasts occurred early in the morning at a site where Russia's 47th Separate Air Assault Battalion of the 155th Separate Guards Marine Brigade was stationed.

The 155th Marine Brigade has been actively involved in the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including battles in Mariupol and Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, as well as operations in Russia's Kursk Oblast.

Local media reported two loud bangs, followed by temporary road closures and emergency vehicles seen in the area, but did not mention anything about a military base.

Russia's Anti-Terrorist Commission of Primorsky Krai attributed the explosions to the ignition of propane-butane cylinders inside a vehicle. No official casualties have been reported.

One of the explosions allegedly happened near a checkpoint, while the other hit the location of personnel and the unit's command.

""Manpower, military equipment, and special equipment were hit,"" the source claimed.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""fundamentally in favor"" of meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on May 30, according to Russian state news agency TASS.

The statement comes amid renewed diplomatic maneuvering to schedule the next round of peace talks in Istanbul, tentatively proposed for June 2.

Peskov stressed that a high-level summit would require concrete outcomes from the negotiations between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations.

""President Putin has repeatedly said that he is fundamentally in favor of high-level contacts, which are undoubtedly needed,"" Peskov said. ""But they must be prepared, and first, a result must be achieved in negotiations between the delegations.""

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said on May 30 that Turkey would be open to hosting a possible meeting among the three leaders, with the participation of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as well. Fidan's statement followed his visits to both Kyiv and Moscow.

Zelensky previously invited Putin to Istanbul for direct talks on May 16, proposing a three-way format with Trump to push forward peace efforts. Putin declined to attend, sending a low-level delegation led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.

The Istanbul talks ended without agreement on a ceasefire or broader political settlement, though the sides did agree to the largest prisoner exchange of the full-scale war.

Moscow has rejected Kyiv's repeated calls for a complete and unconditional ceasefire, despite mounting international pressure. Russia has instead intensified its aerial assaults across Ukraine and is reportedly preparing for a renewed summer offensive.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov confirmed on May 29 that Moscow plans to present a draft ""ceasefire memorandum"" at the June 2 meeting in Istanbul. He added that Medinsky's team would be prepared to explain its content to the Ukrainian delegation.

Zelensky's Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said on May 29 that Kyiv is open to the talks but insists that Russia share the memorandum ahead of the meeting.

The Kremlin has repeatedly attacked Zelensky's legitimacy as president, pointing out that his first presidential term was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024.

Ukraine's constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia's full-scale invasion began in 2022. As a result, Zelensky's term has been extended, which constitutional lawyers argue is permitted under Ukrainian law.

Trump, who held a two-hour phone call with Putin on May 19 and is pushing to broker a ceasefire deal, has backed the idea of a high-level summit.

Ukraine’s proposed memorandum to Russia includes provisions for a ceasefire on land, in the air, and at sea, to be monitored by international partners, the New York Times (NYT) reported on May 30, citing an unnamed senior Ukrainian official.

Ukraine has submitted its document to the Russian side ahead of a second round of peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow that may take place in Istanbul on June 2, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on May 28.

The points reported by NYT echo Ukraine’s and its partners’ long-standing call for a comprehensive, unconditional ceasefire on land, in the air, and at sea for at least 30 days — a proposal Russia has consistently ignored.

The peace talks in Istanbul also concluded on May 16 with no agreement between the two sides on a ceasefire. Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Serhii Kyslytsia, who was present at the Istanbul talks, said that Russia's negotiating team in Istanbul has repeatedly stated that ""an unconditional ceasefire is categorically unacceptable.""

Moscow has proposed June 2 as the date for the next round of talks with Ukraine, despite escalating its attacks on the country.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on May 29 that the Russian delegation, led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, is prepared to present the ceasefire memorandum to the Ukrainian side and provide necessary clarifications during the next Istanbul meeting.

As Russia ramps up its missile and drone strikes countrywide, all eyes are on Europe’s capacity to continue supporting Ukraine, with the future of U.S. military aid growing ever more uncertain.

Ukraine should have enough air defense missiles despite the persisting shortage to avoid the worst of the attacks, but much depends on the intensity of the Russian campaigns, according to experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent.

“I think what the Russians are doing now is trying to test how deep the pockets are and how large the inventories are on the Ukrainian and European side,” said Mikkel Vedby Rasmussen, professor at the University of Copenhagen, who specializes in military strategy and defense policy.

“If the Russians are actually able to, which they might not be, continue a very high operational tempo and thus deplete Ukrainian stocks, then I think it would be more difficult.”

Europe’s ability to bolster its own production line of air defense missiles and the possibility of continuing to buy interceptors from the U.S. to increase its capacity would be the major factors for Ukraine, the experts said.

Ukraine’s increasing reliance on Europe comes four months after U.S. President Donald Trump, who has held close ties with Russia, took over the White House. Trump has since then pushed both sides for a peace deal to end the war at all costs, threatening to walk away if there is no progress made in the near future.

Uncertainty mounts over the future of the military aid and intelligence sharing from the U.S., Ukraine’s most important ally.

Even as Moscow stepped into the peace talks and held a direct meeting with Kyiv for the first time in three years, Russian troops intensified missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, far from the battlefield. The deadly attacks raised questions about Moscow’s intent.

Missile shortage

Over the weekend, Russia launched a series of aerial assaults on Kyiv and other cities using dozens of missiles and drones, with the May 25 campaign killing 12 civilians across the country, according to Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko.

Ukraine has faced a shortage of air defense missiles, a source in the Air Force told the Kyiv Independent in April. The chronic shortage forces Ukraine to ration its resources even as Russia deploys more ballistic missiles in such attacks.

While Ukraine has received a variety of air defense weapons since the onset of the war, only the PAC-3 Patriot air defense missiles offer a reliable shield from Russia’s ballistic missiles due to their speed.

The Düsseldorf-based defense company Rheinmetall announced that talks are ongoing to create a joint venture with the U.S. Lockheed Martin, which produces PAC-3 Patriot missiles. The aim is to produce up to 10,000 missiles from long-range ATACMS to PAC-3, and that it would be ready in about a year, Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger said.

Lockheed Martin said that it produced 500 PAC-3 Patriot missiles in 2024 and plans to produce 650 per year.

Experts argue that Europe should have ramped up the production of these crucial weapons sooner, as such a process takes time.

“This process (European arms production) has been much too slow going since 2022, and it is still not at the tempo we would like,” Professor Rasmussen told the Kyiv Independent.

The Copenhagen-based expert believes that Ukraine’s ability to defend its own sky would depend in the short term on “whether Europe is willing to empty its own stocks and (whether it is) able to buy from the Americans in order to supplement stocks.”

Ukrainian aviation expert Kostiantyn Kryvolap also stressed that his country “critically depends” on Europe, as it is “the only partner we can count on” with Trump’s return to power.

“I think that Europe could transfer some of the missiles from the Patriot systems to us, but they keep them, as they say, in reserve, just in case,” Kryvolap told the Kyiv Independent, though the data on Europe’s stocks remains unclear.

Kryvolap pointed out that as the war moves into a phase of “harder strikes and more attention to the (remaining) resources,” Europe’s dependability is important. But rather than waiting for the missiles to fly toward Ukrainian cities, the expert said the bigger focus should be on the long-range strikes on companies that produce components and fuel for these missiles.

The U.S. would continue sending military aid to Ukraine that was already committed before, at about a billion dollars a month ""for quite a while,"" according to Retired U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).

“This is a priority area for Europe both because of Ukraine’s own urgent needs and because this is recognized as gap in Europe’s own defenses.”

Cancian said that with Trump showing frustrations for Russia’s intensifying aerial attacks, it is likely that the U.S. would still allow Europe to buy American inventories, as it also helps both domestic employment and manufacturing.

For the near term, Europe buying missiles and launchers from the U.S. should be enough for Ukraine “to get by” until it rebuilds its own defense industry, according to Cancian. He added that cheaper and more available variants such as U.S.-provided NASAMS air defense missiles and surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) should prevent most Russian attacks, with Moscow firing only “a handful of ballistic missiles.”

“It wouldn't stop everything but it would maybe stop the most dangerous attacks,” Cancian told the Kyiv Independent.

The U.S. has received about 1,900 PAC-3 Patriot missiles, which are the most up-to-date variants, and produces about 20 a month, Cancian said.

But the real concern is if the U.S. does shut off its military aid to Ukraine, again, as it did in February after the Oval Office clash with President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“The Europeans will always produce some, so it’s not like Ukraine would have nothing,” Cancian said.

“But obviously what the Ukrainians want, understandably, is more.”

Luigi Scazzieri, a senior policy analyst for defense at the Paris-based European Union Institute for Security Studies, pointed out that another key question is whether the U.S. would greenlight Europe to hand over the U.S. interceptors produced in Europe to Ukraine.

“That could be a significant source of supply and there are signs that the U.S. is willing to do so – earlier this month it allowed Germany to transfer Patriots to Ukraine,” Scazzieri told the Kyiv Independent.

“This is a priority area for Europe both because of Ukraine’s own urgent needs and because this is recognized as a gap in Europe’s own defenses.”",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2216050531.jpg

A lot depends on the circumstances under which you try to define or feel your own loneliness.

Let me begin with my biography — my recent story. I joined the army in the first days of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, as an officer in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I had never served in the military before, and I never thought I would.

In fact, I considered myself an anti-militarist — and still do.

Yet, I see no contradiction between that and being proudly a senior lieutenant in the Armed Forces. Within three and a half months of participating in the liberation of the Kyiv Oblast and other operations further east, half of my platoon — eight of my subordinates and I — was captured by Russian forces in Luhansk Oblast.

What followed were two years and four months of Russian captivity. I was a prisoner of war, held the entire time in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory — the very region we were defending.

For some reason, keeping me as a POW wasn’t enough — perhaps because they learned I was a journalist and human rights activist.

A few months into my captivity, they fabricated a criminal case against me. The following year, I was sentenced as a “war criminal” to 13 years in a penal colony for supposed heinous crimes.

I felt lonely because of what I had experienced.

The only evidence against me was a confession — extracted under duress. I prefer that phrasing, as it avoids the word “torture.”

I was part of a prisoner exchange in October of last year.

Naturally, I’m incredibly happy to be free. But it also breaks my heart — almost everyone I spent those years with in captivity, except for two, are still there. And of my own platoon, four remain incarcerated.

As a former POW, when you’re released and return to your native city — Kyiv, which I’ve never loved more — you meet hundreds, even thousands, of wonderful people, joyful to see you free. I felt an overwhelming lightness, warmth, and happiness. And yet, at the same time, I understood — and so did many of them — that something fundamental had changed between us. I felt lonely because of what I had experienced.

I’ve been to places and seen things they never have — and I hope they never will. But I also realized that our worldviews had diverged. How we see and feel the world is no longer the same.

Most of them, when they thought about it — without any prompting — said, “No, we don’t know what you went through.” And that’s true for every former prisoner of war or civilian detainee.

This is what distinguishes a war veteran or a civilian under occupation from everyone else. We are shaped by what we live through.

It’s a strange thing, to feel lonely in such a significant — perhaps even defining — part of your life. But it’s a kind of chosen loneliness, because you don’t want others to feel what you felt. You don’t want them to go through what you endured.

In captivity, our guards deliberately tried to inflict another kind of loneliness. They worked to break us — morally, psychologically, and yes, physically. Especially in the first several months, we were held incommunicado, with no contact with the outside world.

They repeatedly told us: “You’ve been abandoned. Everyone has forgotten you. You are on your own. You're at our mercy. No one can reach you. We can do whatever we want. No one cares.”

I was lucky. I never believed it. Not for a single second — not even in the darkest moments. I placed all my trust in my loved ones — my family, my friends, my colleagues, and just kind people out there — believing they remembered me, remembered us.

Other Ukrainian POWs came to hear me say it out loud: “We are not forgotten.” That kind of destructive loneliness didn’t work. Physically, we were isolated — but morally, we were not.

“You don’t know what’s happening. You don’t understand. Wake up.”

The loneliness I felt after my release was of a different kind. It wasn’t about isolation. It was more complex. At the same time, I knew I was free because of other people. They had written letters, led campaigns, given interviews, and posted on social media. In the final months of my captivity, I learned there was a campaign of solidarity for me — but I couldn’t have imagined the scale of it.

After my release, I kept meeting strangers who had participated in it. And I know I am free, to the extent possible, because of them.

I had plenty of time in captivity to reflect. My first degree is in philosophy — it never fades. I realized I had never treasured people as deeply as I do now. I began to grasp how much I am human — at my best — because of others.

I recently returned from an advocacy trip across Europe, specifically within the EU. And I felt something many Ukrainians abroad have shared with me — being in a peaceful country untouched by what we’ve endured for more than three years now.

I felt joy simply observing people. Watching groups of young people rushing through their day-to-day lives. I was so happy to see people living in normalcy. They should not endure what we’re living through. That’s a good thing. That’s human.

War is a state of profound dehumanization. People aren’t meant to live through it. I was glad to see them. But at the same time, I felt like I knew something they didn’t. I had this urge to walk up to someone, shake them, and say, “You don’t know what’s happening. You don’t understand. Wake up.”

It’s a kind of loneliness rooted in experience — that of a former prisoner of war. We’ve lived through something I sincerely hope no other community or country will ever have to experience. And as terrible as it sounds, I want us to be alone in that experience. Because if we’re not, it means we failed to defend ourselves, and others had to share this tragedy with us.

I would hope we rather remain lonely in that regard.

Ukraine is ready to attend the second round of peace talks with the Russian delegation in Istanbul on June 2, but seeks to receive a draft of Russia’s proposed ceasefire memorandum before the meeting, said Presidential Office Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak on May 29.

Ukraine and Russia held peace talks in Istanbul on May 16, where both sides agreed to a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange. The peace negotiations were largely inconclusive, with Moscow reiterating maximalist demands and sending a delegation of lower-level officials.

Moscow has proposed June 2 as the date for the next round of talks with Ukraine, despite escalating its attacks on the country.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on May 29 that the Russian delegation, led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, is prepared to present the memorandum to the Ukrainian side and provide necessary clarifications during the next Istanbul meeting.

Kyiv insists on receiving the memorandum ahead of the new round of talks in order to understand Russia’s proposed steps toward a ceasefire. Ukraine has already submitted its own document to the Russian side.

""Ukraine is ready to attend the next meeting, but we want to engage in a constructive discussion. This means it is important to receive Russia’s draft. There is enough time – four days are sufficient for preparing and sending the documents,"" Yermak said during a conversation with advisors to the leaders of the U.K., Germany, France, and Italy.

Security advisors from the four countries are expected to attend the second round of peace talks in Istanbul, U.S. President Donald Trump's Special Envoy Keith Kellogg said.

Russia vowed to present its peace memorandum but has yet to deliver, drawing rebuke from Ukrainian, European, and U.S. officials. Trump has also repeatedly signaled he would exit the peace efforts unless progress is achieved soon.

Dmytro Bodyu, a U.S. citizen and the pastor of the ""Word of Life"" Pentecostal Church in Russian-occupied Melitopol, was detained by Russians in March 2022. During his detention, he was accused of working for the CIA and received death threats from the Russian military.

Only an intervention by the U.S. State Department saved him.

""On the morning of March 19, several military vehicles and a couple of civilian cars stopped outside our home. Around 15 Russian soldiers were in full gear, wearing balaclavas and carrying shields... They treated me like a Mexican drug lord. They jumped over the fence, went through neighboring yards, and entered from all sides at once,"" Bodyu recalls in an in-depth interview for the Kyiv Independent's new investigative documentary ""No God But Theirs.""

The pastor and his family were warned by the U.S. Embassy and given advice to leave Melitopol one month before the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine started. But Bodyu decided he could not abandon his Church.

During his detention, Russian special services repeatedly accused him of working for the CIA and demanded that he disclose his call sign and his ""handler from Langley,"" he says.

""It felt like being in a psychiatric ward — you're an absolutely normal, healthy person, but they try to convince you that you're a schizophrenic, you just don't know it, and that soon you'll realize you're exactly where you should be,"" Bodyu recalls.

Meanwhile, Russian soldiers threatened to kill him.

They took whatever they wanted. There are no laws; nothing functions in the occupied territories.

""The soldiers said: 'We have orders to shoot you. Now, we will question you. We know who you are, what you are. You're a CIA employee, a spy. You gave away our positions, our people died because of you. You led protests in the city, you're giving money to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, you lead the partisans here' — things like that,"" the pastor says.

After eight days, his time in detention was cut short.

""We had an interrogation (with an FSB operative) during the day, and in the evening, he comes in and says, 'Well, that's it, you're going home.' And I'm like, 'What do you mean? That's unexpected.' He says, 'It was unexpected for us too, believe me.' I ask, 'So who decided I should go home?' He says, 'They decided up top.' I say, 'What do you mean? God decided?' He says, 'No, Moscow decided to release you.'""

After his release, Bodyu and his family left Melitopol.

They are now living near Kyiv. In Melitopol, his Pentecostal Church ""Word of Life"" was officially banned by the Russian occupation authorities a day after Christmas — on Dec. 26, 2022. The Church's building is now occupied by a department of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. Russian authorities also confiscated all of Bodyu's businesses (he owned seven cafes and restaurants in Melitopol).

""I call them pirates. That's what they are — pirates. They took whatever they wanted. There are no laws; nothing functions in the occupied territories."" Bodyu says.

In the investigative documentary ""No God But Theirs,"" the Kyiv Independent's journalists also identified several officials implicated in the persecution of Ukrainian Christians in Melitopol.

Besides Dmytro Bodyu's Church, the Russian-occupation authorities also banned several other Churches — Melitopol's largest Protestant Church ""New Generation,"" the Baptist Church ""Grace"" and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church subordinated to the Vatican.

Residents in Russian regions along the Ukrainian border complain the area is increasingly uninhabitable due to the government's actions amid Moscow's attempt to establish a ""buffer zone,"" according to a call intercepted by Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) and posted May 29.

Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed on May 22 that he ordered the military to begin creating a ""security buffer zone"" along the border of Kursk, Bryansk, and Belgorod oblasts.

In the call, a resident of Russia's Belgorod Oblast claims that authorities have cut off gas along the border. The speaker predicts mandatory evacuations will follow as living conditions worsen.

""Well, in short, it's clear that they're going to kick everyone out of the border areas and create a gray zone,"" the unidentified individual says.

""Gray zones"" refer to areas along the border and front lines where there is contested or unclear control.

The resident speaking on the call anticipates that the area will become so heavily militarized it will be partitioned from the rest of the region.

""Let them make temporary settlements, zones, and that's it. They'll even fence it off with barbed wire,"" the resident says.

Russia's Belogorod Oblast, which borders Ukraine's Sumy, Kharkiv, and Luhansk oblasts, is regularly used as a staging area for Russian attacks on Ukrainian territory. Russian officials have also accused Kyiv of repeatedly launching strikes on the region and the city of Belgorod since the war began.

Ukraine launched a small-scale offensive in Belgorod Oblast in late March, marking Kyiv's second cross-border operation in Russian territory after the August 2024 Kursk incursion.

Russian forces are now reportedly amassing along the border in preparation for a possible offensive against Ukraine's Sumy Oblast, according to the State Border Guard Service.

Moscow has repeatedly indicated plans to create a buffer zone between Ukraine and Russia in the area.

Ukrainian soldiers hit and destroyed in May more than 89,000 Russian targets using drones of various types, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on May 30.

Syrskyi did not specify which targets were hit. Throughout Russia's all-out war, Ukrainian drones have been used to target Russian vehicles, troops, as well as fortified positions.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims.

Ukraine has pioneered drone technology during Russia's full-scale war, introducing various ground-, air-, and sea-based models for combat and reconnaissance missions.

According to Syrskyi, Russia is adopting Ukraine’s drone warfare tactics and expanding its use of unmanned units.

During the meeting with Ukrainian commanders, intelligence briefed Syrskyi that the Russian army had received new types of drones and ground-based robotic systems. In response, Ukraine is ramping up the number of drone crews and advancing its own unmanned capabilities, Syrskyi said.

""Each drone means a destroyed enemy, and therefore a saved life of a Ukrainian serviceman. A special emphasis is placed on the destruction of enemy UAV (unmanned aerial vehicles) operators and their command centers,"" the commander added.

Thirty drones were intercepted by electronic warfare or disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement.

Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are usually decoys. Russia launches them alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine's air defense.

NATO's eastward expansion is a ""fair"" concern for Russian President Vladimir Putin, U.S. President Donald Trump's Special Envoy Keith Kellogg said in an interview with ABC News on May 29.

As one of the conditions for ending the full-scale war against Ukraine, Putin demanded a written pledge by NATO not to accept more Eastern European members, which would effectively block Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova from joining, Reuters reported earlier this week.

Moscow has claimed that Ukraine's NATO aspirations were one of the key causes of its invasion. Russian aggression against Ukraine began in 2014 with the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas, a time when Kyiv had little prospect of joining the alliance in the foreseeable future.

When asked whether Trump would commit to halting NATO expansion, Kellogg replied that ""it's a fair concern.""

Trump's special envoy also reiterated that Ukraine's membership in the alliance ""is not on the table,"" adding that Washington is not alone in its hesitation, as several other member states share similar doubts about Kyiv’s accession.

""And that's one of the issues Russia will bring up... They're also talking about Georgia, they're talking about Moldova, they're talking — obviously — about Ukraine. And we're saying, 'Okay, let's address this comprehensively,'"" Kellogg said.

According to him, a decision of NATO's expansion would ultimately be up to the U.S. president, and any agreement would likely involve negotiations between Trump, Putin, and President Volodymyr Zelensky to reach a settlement of the Russia's war.

Trump has repeatedly echoed Moscow's narrative that Ukraine's efforts to join NATO have been one of the root causes of the full-scale invasion.

In March this year, Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha rejected restrictions on joining international alliances and organizations — namely, NATO and the EU — as part of a potential peace deal.

Security advisors from the U.S., U.K., France, and Germany will attend planned peace talks between Ukraine and Russia on June 2, U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said in an interview with ABC News on May 29.

""We'll have what we call the E3. That is the national security advisors from Germany, France, and Great Britain... When we were in London, they kind of helped us mold a term sheet for Ukraine,"" Kellogg said.

Ukraine and Russia held peace talks in Istanbul on May 16, where both sides agreed to a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange. The peace negotiations were largely inconclusive, with Moscow reiterating maximalist demands and sending a delegation of lower-level officials.

""What they're doing with their ballistic missiles, with the Iskanders firing into cities like Kyiv, or using their drones shooting into Kyiv... When they did that the other day, that's a direct violation of what's called the Geneva protocols,"" Kellogg said, reiterating previous statements.

Trump, on May 19, held a two-hour phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin during which Russia reiterated its refusal to a full ceasefire in its war against Ukraine.

""He's killing a lot of people... I don't know what the hell happened to Putin, I've known him for a long time,"" Trump said on May 25. In the same statement, Trump told journalists sanctions against Russia could be on the table amid Russia's intensified attacks.

Despite the peace talks in Turkey, Russia has increased drone and missile attacks against Ukraine.

Despite recent peace talks, Moscow has refused a ceasefire and instead insisted it will provide Ukraine with a memorandum of a peace proposal.

Russia has not given Ukraine the proposal despite indicating it would once peace talks concluded on May 16. Kyiv has not yet officially announced it will attend the next peace talks slated to take place on June 2 in Turkey.

Kellogg on May 27 criticized former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for comments that alluded to the threat of World War III, calling them ""reckless"" and ""unfitting of a world power.""

""Trump... is working to stop this war and end the killing. We await receipt of (the Russian) Memorandum... that you promised a week ago. Cease fire now,"" Kellogg said.

Leader of the Georgian opposition party ""Coalition for Change,"" Nika Melia, was detained by authorities on May 29, NewsGeorgia reported, citing Melia's associates.

Melia is being investigated for refusing to testify before a parliamentary committee probing former President Mikheil Saakashvili's time in power.

The opposition leader was arrested just before he was scheduled to appear on a television show, Melia's associates said.

""I do not know what his detention was connected with. In fact, he was kidnapped. They acted aggressively and without explanation,"" Melia's lawyer, Georgy Kondakhashvili, claimed.

The ruling ""Georgian Dream"" party has tightened its grip on power, passing a foreign agents law similar to Russia's. Mass protests erupted in Georgia in 2023 and 2024 in response to moves by authorities, which have isolated the country from the West.

Many opposition figures have not recognized Georgia's ruling party, following disputed parliamentary elections in December 2024.

Melia's commission hearing was postponed from May 29 to May 30, he has refused to attend the proceeding thus far.

Kondakhashvili claims there are no legal grounds for Melia's arrest and says the charges were likely fabricated to forcibly bring the opposition leader to the hearing he has boycotted.

Melia does not view the parliament and commission led by the ""Georgian Dream"" party as legitimate, and in late April, refused to pay a bail of 50,000 lari ($18,200), NewsGeorgia reported.

Editor's note: This article has been updated with comments by Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on May 29 denied Russian foreign intelligence (SVR) claims that Serbian defense enterprises continue to supply ammunition to Ukraine, despite Belgrade's stated neutrality.

""The Serbian defense industry is trying to shoot Russia in the back,"" the agency's statement read.

The Serbian government has maintained friendly ties with Russia under Vucic, who has denied previous claims of Serbian arms supplies to Ukraine.

Belgrade has positioned itself as neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war, striving to balance its position as an EU candidate with its long-standing relationship with Moscow.

Russian intelligence accused Serbian companies of funneling arms to Ukraine via third-party intermediaries, namely NATO countries like Czechia, Poland, and Bulgaria.

""More recently, exotic options involving African countries have also been used for this purpose,"" the report claimed.

The Serbian contribution amounts to ""hundreds of thousands of shells for multiple-launch rocket systems and howitzers, as well as a million small arms sounds,"" according to the intelligence report.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims made by Russian officials.

Later on May 29, Vucic denied the allegations made by Russian intelligence, saying that some of the claims are not true.

""For example, they correctly say that there is a contract with the Czech Republic. But no permission was given, and none of the missiles were delivered"" to Ukraine, Vucic told Serbian outlet RTS.

U.S. President Donald Trump hopes that the forthcoming peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia will ""move the ball forward"" on his efforts to broker a peace deal, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on May 29.

Moscow proposed that the next round of direct talks be held on June 2 in Istanbul, where Russia will present a long-awaited memorandum outlining its conditions for a ceasefire. President Volodymyr Zelensky has criticized Russia's delay in releasing its terms as a stalling tactic.

Trump claimed on May 28 that it would ""take about two weeks, or week and a half,"" to know if Russian President Vladimir Putin was stalling or truly interested in peace.

In response to a question about Trump's recent comments, Leavitt said that the U.S. expects the Istanbul talks to go forward.

""It is my understanding and it is our hope that Russia and Ukraine will engage in direct talks and negotiations next week in Istanbul,"" she told reporters.

""And we believe that meeting is going to take place, and that is a meeting the president encouraged and urged, for these two sides to come together and negotiate directly. And the president has been clear from the very beginning of this conflict that he wants to see this conflict solved on the negotiating table, not on the battlefield.""

Trump has expressed his hopes for a negotiated settlement to both Putin and Zelensky in private and public comments, Leavitt said.

""So hopefully next week it will move the ball forward in this effort.""

Leavitt did not confirm whether or not Trump would be participating directly in the next round of peace talks, saying she would update the press if the president chose to send a representative.

Washington's attempts to broker a peace deal have not yielded any substantial breakthroughs thus far. For months, Moscow has resisted pressure to impose a full 30-day ceasefire, instead proposing (and subsequently violating) partial short-term truces, calling for further talks, and insisting Kyiv make extreme concessions to maximalist demands.

Meanwhile, Russia has dramatically escalated drone and missile attacks against civilian targets in Ukraine.

While Ukraine has been ready to accept a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire since March 11, the Kremlin has refused, dragging out the process with inconclusive talks while building up its forces in preparation for another military offensive in Ukraine this summer.

During a phone call with Putin on May 19, Trump was told that a ""memorandum of peace"" outlining conditions for a ceasefire would be delivered shortly. The Kremlin's failure to deliver the memorandum amid mass attacks signaled Russia's lack of urgency regarding the peace process.

Trump has at times criticized Putin for appearing to delay the negotiations, but has never followed through on any of his sanctions threats.

Russia and North Korea have engaged in ""unlawful military cooperation,"" including arms transfers of up to 9 million shells and ""at least 100 ballistic missiles"" in 2024, according to a report by the Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team (MSMT) published May 29.

The MSMT is made up of 11 United Nations member states and was formed in October 2024 to monitor and report on the implementation of UN sanctions against North Korea in light of deepening military ties between Moscow and Pyongyang.

The watchdog's first report presents evidence that North Korea and Russia violated United Nations Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs) and engaged in illegal activities throughout 2024.

Violations include deliveries of weapons and military equipment, Russian training of North Korean troops for deployment in direct combat against Ukrainian forces, supply of refined petroleum products to North Korea above UN-mandated caps, and correspondent banking between the two countries.

In 2024 alone, North Korea sent Russia at least 100 ballistic missiles, an MSMT participating state found. These missiles ""were subsequently launched into Ukraine to destroy civilian infrastructure and terrorize populated areas such as Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia,"" the report said.

Russian-flagged vessels delivered ""as many as 9 million rounds of mixed artillery and multiple rocket launcher ammunition"" from North Korea to Russia in 49 shipments from January to December 2024, an MSMT participating state found. The cargo was sent from Russia's far-eastern ports to ammunition depots in southwestern Russia for use in the full-scale war against Ukraine.

Open-source data reviewed by the Open Source Centre (OSC) indicates that Russian vessels delivered between 4.2 and 5.8 million rounds of 122 mm and 152 mm ammunition between August 2023 and March 2025.

The report also confirmed that North Korea deployed over 11,000 soldiers to Russia's Kursk Oblast for training and combat operations against Ukrainian troops.

According to the MSMT, ""these forms of unlawful cooperation ... contributed to Moscow's ability to increase its missile attacks against Ukrainian cities including targeted strikes against critical civilian infrastructure.""

The MSMT also documented transfers of arms from Russia to North Korea. Moscow is believed to have sent Pyongyong short-range air defense systems, advanced electronic warfare systems, and at least one Pantsir-class combat vehicle, the report said.

Russia provided additional support to North Korea's ballistic missile development program, leading to improvements in missile guidance performance, and MSMT participating state said.

The documented arms transfers violate longstanding UN embargoes on material shipments between UN member states and North Korea.

North Korea reportedly began supplying Russia with weapons in 2023. Pyongyang's involvement in the war escalated in fall 2024, when thousands of North Korean troops were dispatched to Russia's western border. The deployment came several months after the two nations signed a defense treaty in June, requiring either state to render military aid to the other in the event of an attack.

Despite this, North Korea only publicly admitted its involvement in Russia's war against Ukraine in late April 2025. North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un said in May that his country's participation in the war was part of a ""sacred mission.""

Recent days have also seen a surge in Russian aerial attacks against Ukraine. For three nights in a row, Moscow barraged cities across Ukraine with drones and missiles, including ballistics. The MSMT report confirmed that Russia has attacked Ukraine with North Korean-made ballistic missiles — and that these weapons contain foreign parts provided by third-party distributors.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2157787216.jpg

The Kyiv Independent's investigative documentary, ""He Came Back,"" which exposes sexual violence committed by Russian soldiers in Ukraine, has won the 2025 Ukrainian journalism award, ""Honor of the Profession.""

The winners were announced during an award ceremony in Kyiv on May 29.

The documentary, which identifies perpetrators of sexual violence in occupied Ukrainian territories, was recognized in the Best Investigative Report category.

The film was authored by journalist Olesia Bida, a member of the Kyiv Independent's War Crimes Investigations Unit. The team also included editing director Maksym Yakobchuk, researchers Kostiantyn Nechyporenko and Myroslava Chaiun, and editor Yevheniia Motorevska.

""Sexual violence in war is a war crime and a systemic strategy used by Russian forces. ""They face no consequences and continue committing these crimes in occupied territories,"" Bida said, following the award ceremony.

""It meant so much to me that after this investigation was published, one of the soldiers we identified was formally charged by Ukrainian authorities. His case has already been sent to court. I hope one day he will face a real sentence.""

Bida called the piece ""the most important work of my entire journalism career,"" and expressed deep gratitude to the Kyiv Independent team for supporting her through 10 months of research and reporting.

""We are endlessly inspired by your work,"" the Ukrainian competition committee said in a statement, thanking every journalist who submitted work this year. ""You are the witnesses and chroniclers of the country's life and its people during the most difficult period of our modern history.""

The film previously won the Best Film award at the 2024 Press Play Prague film festival.

Since its foundation in 2023, the Kyiv Independent's War Crimes Investigations Unit has released nine documentary films, exposing Russia's kidnapping of Ukrainian children, torture of prisoners of war, repressions in occupied territories, and crackdown on religious communities.

The ""Honor of the Profession"" contest, organized annually in Ukraine, celebrates excellence in categories including best interview, war reporting, analytical writing, and publicist essays. This year's winners reflect the difficult reality and courage of reporting in a country at war.



A special nomination from the Supervisory Board of the contest ""For dedication to the profession under the most difficult conditions"" was posthumously given to late Victoriia Roshchyna, who died in Russian captivity after disappearing in August 2023 while reporting from occupied territories.

Her body, returned in February, showed signs of torture, including electric shocks and possible strangulation. A forensic examination revealed missing organs, suggesting an attempt to hide the cause of death.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/collage.jpg

Next Ramstein summit to take place on June 4 in Brussels

A building was reportedly damaged on the outskirts of Moscow following a Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian capital overnight on May 29, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin reported.

This marks the second consecutive day of attacks on Moscow Oblast, with multiple industrial facilities targeted by Ukrainian drones and several unmanned aircraft reportedly downed on approach to the capital on May 28.

Videos and photos posted on social media by local residents purportedly show damage sustained by a residential building on Vernadsky Avenue in Southwest Moscow. Explosions were heard in the area around 1:40 a.m. local time.

Sobyanin claimed that no one was injured in the attack that occurred as a result of falling drone debris.

The full extent of the damage was not immediately clear. Ukraine's military has not commented on the reported attack.

Russian air defenses shot down 48 Ukrainian drones overnight, including three over Moscow Oblast, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed.

The Kyiv Independent cannot independently verify reports or claims made by Russian officials.

The previous night on May 28, Russian air defenses shot down 296 Ukrainian drones across multiple regions overnight, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed, potentially marking one of the heaviest drone attacks against Russia during the full-scale war.

Rubio, Lavrov discuss next round of Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov presented to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio Moscow's ""specific proposals"" for the next round of peace talks with Ukraine, Russia's Foreign Ministry announced on May 29.

The two diplomats held a phone call on May 28, the day when Russia proposed holding negotiations with Ukraine in Istanbul on June 2 in a follow-up to the first round on May 16.

Lavrov also ""informed Marco Rubio about implementing the May 19 agreements between President of Russia Vladimir Putin and President of the United States Donald Trump,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said.

Trump and Putin held a phone call on May 19, during which the Russian leader again rejected a truce and pushed for maximalist demands, but also voiced his readiness to negotiate a ""memorandum regarding a potential future peace treaty.""

During the call with Lavrov, Rubio stressed Trump's ""intention to quickly bring the Ukraine conflict to an end and expressed Washington's readiness to help the sides to bring their positions closer together,"" according to the Russian readout.

While initially reluctant to criticize Putin, Trump adopted an increasingly critical tone toward the Russian leader in recent days as Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities intensify and the Kremlin continues to reject calls for a ceasefire.

Kyiv and its European partners have urged the U.S. to impose additional sanctions to pressure Moscow to agree to a truce. Trump has refused to take the step so far, saying he is ""close to getting a deal"" and does not want to ""screw it up"" by fresh sanctions.

'No one has seen it yet' — Zelensky slams Russia for stalling on ceasefire memorandum ahead of Istanbul talks

President Volodymyr Zelensky on May 29 accused Russia of stalling the peace process by failing to deliver a promised negotiations memorandum, warning international partners that Moscow is trying to deceive those still relying on diplomacy over pressure.

""Even the so-called memorandum they promised and claimed to be preparing for more than a week — no one has seen it,"" Zelensky said. ""Ukraine hasn't received it. Our partners haven't received it. Even Turkey, which hosted the first meeting, hasn’t received the updated agenda.""

Russia's Foreign Ministry previously claimed its delegation, led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, would present the ceasefire framework at the June 2 talks, proposed by Moscow.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova confirmed on May 29 that the same Russian delegation, led by Medinsky, will attend the new round of peace talks in Istanbul.

Ukraine's Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said Ukraine has already shared its position paper with Russia.

Speaking after a high-level meeting with Umerov, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, and presidential chief of staff Andrii Yermak, Zelensky said Ukraine is maintaining daily coordination with allies ahead of another round of talks in Istanbul.

Zelensky called for renewed international pressure on Russia, saying, ""Words don't work with Moscow. They are doing everything to make these meetings meaningless. That is why sanctions and real pressure on Russia are essential.""

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, whose country hosted the May 16 negotiations, said Ankara expects Ukrainian and Russian positions to come closer.

""If there's a diplomatic achievement here, it's not just thanks to Turkish diplomacy, but to the fact that both sides have been willing to talk and that these talks have led to tangible outcomes,"" Fidan said on his way to Kyiv, where he is expected to meet Sybiha and Zelensky.

Russia amassed enough troops to attack Ukraine's Sumy Oblast, Border Guard warns

Russia has concentrated a sufficient amount of forces in Kursk Oblast to potentially launch an attack on Ukraine’s Sumy Oblast, State Border Guard Service spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said on May 29.

The statement comes amid warnings of a new possible Russian offensive this summer as U.S.-mediated peace efforts have failed to produce a ceasefire deal.

Russia has become increasingly active in Sumy Oblast after mostly pushing out Ukrainian forces from Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian authorities recently confirmed that Russian forces captured four Sumy Oblast villages close to the border: Novenke, Zhuravka, Veselivka, and Basivka.

Speaking on national television, Demchenko said Russia began amassing forces when it attempted to push Ukrainian troops out of Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched its operation in August 2024.

Russia continues to maintain a force in Kursk Oblast, and Ukraine periodically detects a ""certain change in the number of both soldiers and equipment in this area,"" the spokesperson said.

Russia ""has enough forces there (in Kursk Oblast) to carry out operations against our border and attempt to attack the territory of Ukraine,"" he continued.

The remarks came days after President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia is accumulating 50,000 troops near Ukraine's northeastern Sumy Oblast, seeking to create a 10-kilometer buffer zone in the area.

Next Ramstein summit to take place on June 4 in Brussels

The upcoming Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting in the Ramstein format will be held on June 4 in Brussels under the chairmanship of the U.K. and Germany, NATO announced on May 29.

The Ramstein summit will take place as Washington is trying to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia to end Moscow's full-scale war.

In the meantime, Russia is amassing forces for a new offensive against Ukraine while continuing its attacks on civilians across the country, straining Ukrainian air defenses.

The last Ramstein-format meeting took place in Brussels on April 11 under the chairmanship of London and Berlin — a position previously held by the U.S.

Leadership over Ramstein transitioned following the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

During the previous meeting, NATO allies committed more than 21 billion euros ($23.8 billion) in long-term military aid to Ukraine.

The move came amid growing uncertainty over U.S. support for Ukraine and efforts by European allies to close the gap as Kyiv resists Russia's ongoing war.

There is currently no indication that Russia is preparing to restart operations at the occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, an official from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on May 29, despite concerns over recent reports of new Russian infrastructure around the facility, Reuters reported.

""Our teams continue to confirm there is no indication at the moment that there will be any active preparations for a restart of the plant now,"" an IAEA official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The comment follows Ukraine's protest to the IAEA over what it called an illegal Russian attempt to connect the facility to its own energy grid. Yurii Vitrenko, Ukraine's ambassador to the IAEA, said any such move would be a gross violation of international law and Ukrainian sovereignty.

Satellite imagery reviewed in a recent Greenpeace report and cited by the New York Times shows Russia has constructed more than 80 kilometers (49 miles) of high-voltage lines between the occupied cities of Mariupol and Berdiansk since February.

The group said this may be an effort to link the Zaporizhzhia plant to a substation near Mariupol, signaling potential plans to restart the facility and fully integrate it into Russia’s grid.

The Zaporizhzhia plant, located in the Russian-occupied city of Enerhodar, is Europe's largest nuclear facility and has been under Russian control since March 2022. All six of its reactors remain shut down as the war continues, and the site has faced repeated power outages and safety threats due to nearby shelling.

Restarting any of the reactors would require a stable supply of water and external power. The plant lost access to its main cooling source, the Kakhovka reservoir, when the dam was blown up by the Russian forces in June 2023. Wells now supply enough water for cooling during cold shutdown, but not for full operations.

""The plant lost its main source of cooling water, so the whole system cannot work as it was originally designed,"" the IAEA official said. ""The consumption of water is orders of magnitude higher (when the plant is operating) compared to cold shutdown. We don't see any easy, quick fix for it.""

In March, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi told Reuters that restarting the facility could be feasible within months of a lasting ceasefire — something that remains elusive. Meanwhile, Ukraine and Russia are expected to meet in Istanbul for renewed peace talks on June 2.

Previously, the U.S. has reportedly proposed that control over the plant be returned to Ukraine before transferring its management to the U.S. to supply electricity to areas under both Ukrainian and Russian control.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said China has stopped selling drones to Ukraine and Western countries while continuing to supply them to Russia, Bloomberg reported on May 29.

""Chinese Mavic is open for Russians but is closed for Ukrainians,"" Zelensky told reporters, referring to the popular quadcopter drone manufactured by China's DJI.

""There are production lines on Russian territory where there are Chinese representatives,"" he added, according to Bloomberg.

The Mavic, typically a civilian drone used for aerial photography, has been adapted by both Ukrainian and Russian forces for battlefield surveillance and as a weapon platform capable of carrying explosives.

Drones have played a decisive role in the war, with both sides using them for reconnaissance and precision attacks.

On April 7, Zelensky announced that Ukraine would scale up production of unmanned systems ""to the maximum,"" including long-range, ground-based, and fiber-optic drones, which are resistant to electronic warfare.

Zelensky's recent remarks reportedly align with assessments from European officials. One official told Bloomberg that China has not only restricted drone exports to Ukraine and other Western buyers, but has also reduced shipments of drone components, including motor magnets, while ramping up deliveries to Russia.

""When someone is asking whether China is helping Russia, how shall we assess these steps?"" Zelensky said.

Beijing has repeatedly denied aiding either side with military goods. On May 27, the Chinese Foreign Ministry also rejected claims made by Ukrainian intelligence chief Oleh Ivashchenko, who alleged that Beijing provided special chemicals, gunpowder, and other defense-related materials to at least 20 Russian military-industrial facilities.

Ivashchenko also said that as of early 2025, 80% of critical electronic components in Russian drones were of Chinese origin. In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning reiterated that China has ""never provided lethal weapons"" and ""strictly controls dual-use items.""

Despite its claims of neutrality, Beijing has deepened economic and strategic ties with Moscow, prompting Western concerns and NATO's designation of China as a “decisive enabler” of Russian aggression.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/338453958_988468299225904_6526539905246249447_n.jpg

Before his visit to Kyiv, Fidan met with Medinsky and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Fidan said that during the visit, Turkey shared its vision of realistic conditions that could help make a ceasefire attainable.

""We conveyed Turkey's determined efforts in this matter to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, the chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Lavrov, and the intelligence chief. As a key regional actor, Turkey has shared its perspective on the realistic parameters that could make a ceasefire achievable,” Fidan said.

He also added that Russia's current demands for a ceasefire are putting Moscow in ""a relatively weaker position.""



""(U.S. President Donald) Trump expressed a firm desire to see an immediate ceasefire. This encouraged Ukraine and Europe to align more flexibly with the U.S. stance. However, Russia did not show the same flexibility, which has placed it in a relatively weaker position in the eyes of both the U.S. and other proponents of the ceasefire,"" he said

Russia has repeatedly claimed that it would agree on a ceasefire in case the so-called ""root causes"" of war in Ukraine are addressed, meaning its long-standing maximalist demands of Kyiv — the same ones it has voiced since the start of the full-scale invasion and has used as propaganda to justify its aggression against Ukraine.

Among them, Moscow insists Kyiv withdraw from four partially occupied Ukrainian regions it claims to have annexed.

Russia's memorandum also reportedly includes a written pledge that NATO will not expand further eastward, effectively blocking Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova from joining, as well as the lifting of some Western sanctions, resolution of frozen Russian assets, and ""the protection of Russian-speaking Ukrainians.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1523446196.jpg

As Russia's systematic destruction of Ukraine's cultural heritage continues amid the full-scale war, Ukraine's art community is seeking innovative, if not unconventional methods, to preserve their country's legacy — among them blockchain technology.

Officially launched in February 2025, the Ukrainian Fund of Digitized Art (UFDA) was conceived with a bold mission: to digitize Ukrainian art and transform them into non-fungible tokens, or NFTs that could be sold at auction.

The UFDA aims not only to preserve and share Ukrainian cultural heritage but “to engage the global community in the fight for cultural preservation,” as it reads on the organization’s website.

Currently, the UFDA has digitized more than 3,000 works by 60 artists, spanning both contemporary and classic Ukrainian art. The UFDA collaborates closely with artists, museum curators, and other cultural institutions to ensure each work is captured in ultra-high resolution.

“We believe that in the world of digital information, what we do will become extremely valuable (in the art world) and this is what drives us,” said UFDA advisor Petro Bondarevskyi. Bondarevskyi is an early supporter and minority investor in the Kyiv Independent.

“Ukraine will make its mark and set the bar.”

At the same time, while artists involved in the UFDA’s digitization initiative applaud its achievements, they also acknowledge that it raises important, and sometimes even uncomfortable, questions about how art is perceived and valued in the digital age.

A need to refine digitization

Having come up in the museum world, Anna Filippova — founder and curator of UFDA — understood, perhaps more than most, the necessity of digital preservation done right.

“I observed a lot of very low-quality pictures of artists’ work,” Fillippova told the Kyiv Independent.

“Each artwork is captured in a single ultra-high-resolution shot, preserving the original light with exceptional dynamic range.”

“That’s why we first came up with the idea for this project back in 2021 with no name, no structure, no actual idea — except digitizing.”

At the heart of UFDA’s digitization process is Digital Light Capture Technology — a technique that uses a high-end camera and precision lighting to reveal each brushstroke in vivid, high-resolution detail. The final images are captured in ultra-high resolution, ranging from 100 to 400 megapixels, with rich 48-bit color depth.

“Many digitization processes rely on digital stitching — taking multiple photographs and merging them into a single image. That’s not our approach,” Bondarevskyi said.

“Each artwork is captured in a single ultra-high-resolution shot, preserving the original light with exceptional dynamic range.”

The UFDA team, drawing on their roots in the art world, began reaching out to contemporary artists and museum curators with the idea to digitize their work for broader accessibility and preservation.

Can art thrive on blockchain?

With the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, blockchain technology has upended the way many people think about ownership. At the forefront of this digital revolution are NFTs — one-of-a-kind digital certificates on the blockchain that verify ownership of everything from memes to masterpieces of art.

The UFDA emphasizes that neither the organization nor the artists receive financial gain from the sale of these digitized artworks. Instead, all proceeds are directed to support Ukrainian NGOs.

“When an artwork is purchased, the transaction is recorded on a blockchain — creating a digital counterpart to the physical piece, or more simply, a digital analogue,” Bondarevskyi explained.

Buyers who purchase the NFT version of an artwork digitized by the UFDA own it for up to a century, but copyright of the artwork itself, like with the purchase of the physical painting, remains with the artist.

“(The UFDA’s mission) is a way to document our era through culture, which will undoubtedly influence the development of art research.”

The move to tokenize these digital artworks as NFTs came later and remains somewhat tangential to the organization’s main mission, according to Filippova. Yet, both efforts gained a sense of urgency amid Russia’s full-scale war, transforming what might have been a quiet digital experiment into a vital cultural response.

Why pay for a digital version of an artwork instead of the original? The UFDA’s response is simple: as the way people experience art shifts, so too should the way they own it.

“Twenty years ago, many people insisted that cinema could only be truly experienced in a theatre, projected from film. Digital, they claimed, could never match it,” Bondarevskyi said.

“Yet today, virtually every stage of filmmaking is digital: from shooting to post-production to projection. This shift in medium illustrates how technology transforms not just how we consume content, but how we value it. For some collectors, the enduring value and permanence of digital ownership is becoming just as meaningful.""

While many artists involved in the UFDA’s efforts recognize the clear benefits of creating a comprehensive digital archive — one that encourages collaboration and improved practices among artists, curators, and art historians — they also voice some reservations.

Even though the profit of sales goes to benefit NGOs, the commercialization of these digital reproductions raises complex questions for some artists around authorship, artistic intent, and the broader commodification of art.

“When the full-scale war began, the UFDA evacuated works from my studio and digitized everything they took. I’m very grateful to them — they really helped me out several times. But now, I’m not sure I would agree to digitize my most recent works,” artist Kateryna Lysovenko told the Kyiv Independent.

“It feels as though you suddenly have another version of your work — like a second body — that's become alienated from you. It takes on a life of its own, one you no longer understand or control. It's not yours anymore, yet you watch as it moves, not by your hand, going somewhere unknown. Still, it's fascinating to observe.”

Artist Polina Shcherbyna, whose work was also evacuated to safety during the war by UFDA, told the Kyiv Independent that the archive ensures “a digital copy of the piece can actually outlive the original” which for her, during wartime, is especially important.

“This was the start of our collaboration, which has only strengthened and continues to develop,” Shcherbyna told the Kyiv Independent. “(The UFDA’s mission) is a way to document our era through culture, which will undoubtedly influence the development of art research.”

Urgency to act

The UFDA was officially launched three years into Russia’s full-scale war, against the backdrop of a systematic campaign targeting Ukraine’s cultural heritage — an assault defined by both deliberate destruction and calculated theft.

Russian forces have damaged or destroyed more than 1,400 cultural heritage sites and over 2,200 cultural facilities since the start of the full-scale war, according to the latest report released by the Culture Ministry in early April.

The destruction is widespread, impacting an estimated 20% of settlements across the entire country. However, with almost no access to occupied territories and the front-line zones, the true extent of the damage to Ukraine’s cultural heritage is far greater than currently documented.

Aside from destruction, the Russian military has also been stealing Ukraine’s cultural heritage from the occupied territories.

In what has been recognized as the largest museum theft since World War II, Russian occupiers stole over 33,000 artworks and historical artifacts from two Kherson art museums in the fall of 2022.

The Kyiv Independent’s War Crimes Investigations Unit identified in its documentary “Curated Theft” the Russian military officer and three Russian-appointed officials from occupied Crimea who were personally responsible for the theft.

With all this in mind, the UFDA found it important not only to partner with contemporary artists but museums to safeguard during wartime the legacy of seminal Ukrainian artists whose work has defined the nation’s cultural identity.

The UFDA team has digitized 46 paintings from the Nykonor Onatskyi Regional Art Museum in Sumy, including works by 19th-century realist Mykola Pymonenko, known for capturing Ukrainian traditions and daily life.

The museum also includes standout works by 20th-century Ukrainian avant-garde artists like David Burliuk, Vasyl Krychevsky, and Oleksandr Bohomazov. Home to one of the most distinguished art collections in Ukraine, the museum now faces a growing threat due to Sumy’s close proximity to the Russian border.

“We’ve long known how exceptional their collection is, and in November 2023, we began our communication with them,” Filippova said.

“What stood out to us is the museum’s unique and nationally significant holdings, especially in light of its precarious situation: located near the border with the aggressor state, and not yet evacuated, the museum is under constant risk of destruction.”

During a Russian missile strike on April 13 that devastated central Sumy, killing at least 35 and injuring 117, the museum was damaged. It was not the first time that the building was damaged in a Russian attack.

Knowing the history of so many of the Ukrainian artists whose work is held in the museum — and the tragic ends many of them met at the hands of Russian repression over the past centuries — casts a poignant shadow over the UFDA’s mission, according to Filippova.

Each digitized Ukrainian artwork ensures that, even in the worst-case scenario where the physical version is stolen, damaged, or destroyed, the voices and visions of these artists will endure.

Their legacy, preserved through technology, is not only a testament to the cultural richness of Ukraine’s past, but a reminder that its survival is essential for the future to endure as well.

“Given the bloody history of the Ukrainian avant-garde — a story of repeated erasure, exile, and neglect — we felt a strong sense of urgency (in the case with the paintings in the Sumy museum) not to allow yet another chapter of cultural eradication,” Filippova said.

Ukraine's State Bureau of Investigation has completed its probe into Colonel Oleh Poberezhniuk, commander of the 211th Pontoon Bridge Brigade, accusing him of knowingly allowing torture and abuse of soldiers under his command to continue unchecked, the officials said on May 29.

According to the official statement, investigators determined that from February to July 2024, Poberezhniuk was aware of repeated instances of torture and cruel treatment carried out by a subordinate officer but failed to take any action. The officer in question, Senior Lieutenant Vladyslav Pastukh, allegedly beat, humiliated, and tortured fellow servicemen.

Pastukh, who is no longer with the unit, is the son of the brigade's chief of staff and a close associate of Poberezhniuk. Authorities say this personal connection likely influenced the commander's decision to conceal the crimes and avoid reporting them to law enforcement.

Pastukh was charged with abusing his authority in December 2024 after allegedly beating, humiliating, and torturing fellow service members. The commander faces up to 12 years in prison if convicted.



""Instead of protecting the rights of his subordinates, the commander effectively became complicit through criminal inaction, enabling further abuse,"" the bureau said. Such actions, it added, not only violate the law but also pose a serious threat to the internal discipline of Ukraine's Armed Forces during wartime.

Poberezhniuk has been charged with inaction of military authority under martial law, a serious offense under Ukraine's Criminal Code, carrying a sentence of seven to 10 years in prison. The case has been forwarded to Poberezhniuk and his legal team for review before being submitted to court. The Prosecutor General's Office is overseeing the case.

The charges follow a December 2023 Ukrainska Pravda investigation that revealed a pattern of systemic abuse within the brigade, including beatings, extortion, and reports of a soldier being tied to a wooden cross. The report also highlighted widespread nepotism, with multiple family members serving within the same unit.

Following public outcry, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi suspended Poberezhniuk, and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov ordered an internal investigation.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-29_13-26-18.jpg

Christopher Walters, a U.S. filmmaker documenting the Russian war against Ukraine, was injured when a balcony fell on him in central Kyiv, he said on social media on May 29.

Walters posted a video address on Instagram, with visible bruises on his face and a ruined balcony in the background.

""While missiles and drones are flying, we are being injured by balconies due to someone's irresponsibility!"" the filmmaker said in the post.

The incident took place in Kyiv's Podilskyi district in front of a building's entrance, said Tymur Tkachenko, head of the city's military administration.

Kyiv's municipal authorities said in a May 29 statement that workers from the Podilskyi District housing maintenance company immediately cleared the debris and cordoned off the area.

City officials said that technical inspections are now being prepared to assess what repairs are needed. They also noted that the injured individual did not call emergency services or request medical aid at the time.



According to the Kyiv administration, housing maintenance companies cannot access private balconies without the consent of homeowners. It urged those living in older buildings to report signs of structural damage immediately.

Tkachenko, who is in a public conflict with Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, stressed that the accident was ""not a hostile attack but a consequence of many years of inaction.""

Walters said he wants to conduct an investigation to determine the causes of the incident and prevent it from happening again.

Tkachenko added that he would have a ""serious conversation"" with district management companies and instructed the new head of the Podilskyi strict administration to keep in touch with the victim and inspect the damage.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/Chris-Walters.jpg

Ukraine has deployed a new artificial intelligence-powered ""mother drone"" for the first time, marking a major step in the country's expanding use of autonomous battlefield technology, Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced on May 29.

The drone system, developed by Ukraine's defense tech cluster Brave1, can deliver two AI-guided FPV (first-person view) strike drones up to 300 kilometers (186 miles) behind enemy lines, according to Fedorov. Once released, the smaller drones can autonomously locate and hit high-value targets, including aircraft, air defense systems, and critical infrastructure — all without using GPS.

""The system uses visual-inertial navigation with cameras and LiDAR to guide the drones, while AI independently identifies and selects targets,"" Fedorov said.

The system, called SmartPilot, allows the carrier drone to return and be reused for missions within a 100-kilometer range. Each operation costs around $10,000 — hundreds of times cheaper than a conventional missile strike, Fedorov said.

The development comes as Ukraine continues to ramp up domestic drone production. On April 7, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the country would scale up production of unmanned systems ""to the maximum,"" including long-range, ground-based, and fiber-optic drones, which are resistant to electronic warfare.

Ukraine has leaned heavily on technological innovation to offset its disadvantages in manpower and firepower since Russia's full-scale invasion began in 2022. The use of drones, aerial, naval, and ground-based, has become a central feature of both sides' strategies in the war.

Fedorov said Ukraine will continue investing in Ukrainian systems that ""change the rules of the game in technological warfare.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1957348817.jpg

Melitopol, a city in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, has traditionally been a hub of religious and cultural diversity. Numerous Christian churches operated there, not only coexisting but also effectively collaborating with one another. Among them, Protestant churches were some of the most active and influential.

Immediately following the start of Russia's occupation of Melitopol and the wider region in 2022, local Christians faced repression. Clergy were subjected to searches and interrogations by Russian forces. Eventually, several churches were banned and stripped of all property, including their buildings. Priests were either officially deported or forced to flee under threat, with Russian propaganda often accusing them of stockpiling weapons and ammunition. Believers were forced to go underground.

The Kyiv Independent interviewed four Melitopol priests: Bishop Dmytro Bodyu of the Pentecostal Church ""Word of Life,"" Father Oleksandr Bohomaz, a priest of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, and Pastors Mykhailo Brytsyn and Ihor Ivashchuk of the Baptist Church ""Grace.""

Despite grand plans, the European Union’s hoped-for rearmament remains fully dependent on member nations stepping up their own defenses.

In March, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced an 800-million-euro ""Rearm Europe"" plan to build out a defense architecture that has depended on the U.S. since the Cold War.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and U.S. President Donald Trump’s subsequent threats to NATO’s security guarantees have alarmed the EU into at least the appearance of action.

While some member states like Poland, Finland, or, more recently, Germany, are putting real resources into defense, the collective EU government is nowhere near becoming a military power. Its efforts at collective armament are already falling victim to the same infighting that has long dogged the bloc’s most ambitious plans, ranging from the Council of Europe’s ""European Defense Community"" to its failure to mediate the disintegration of Yugoslavia.

Consequently, national governments — not Brussels — are driving European rearmament, now and for the foreseeable future.

""It was the national leaders sitting at the table with (President Volodymyr) Zelensky,"" Sven Kruck, co-CEO of German drone company Quantum Systems, told the Kyiv Independent, referring to meetings with the heads of Germany, France, Poland and the U.K. in Kyiv at the start of May in advance of a prospective ""coalition of the willing"" to protect Ukraine.

""I think we are on the right path with the European national leaders. We are not ready with the European (Union) leaders because they are weak.""

Taking up arms

The long-term problem facing the EU is a temperamental U.S. “European states can't rely on the U.S. anymore. That is clear pretty much across the board,” Patrick Gill-Tiney, a Germany-based fellow focusing on major power relations at the London School of Economics, told the Kyiv Independent.

While the problem of the U.S. is clear, potential European solutions are more fraught. The Rearm plan is misleading, says John Foreman, a former military analyst for the EU as well as a one-time U.K. defense attaché in both Moscow and Kyiv. Primarily, he says, that is because Rearm is masquerading as a new source of funding when it is not.

Rearm includes some loans, but is primarily a new EU authorization to member nations to take on more debt independently. Rearm’s 800 million euros is divided into two parts: one at 150 million euros and one estimated at 650 million euros. The 150 million euros is an EU loan offering to EU members as well as a few non-EU neighbors — notably the U.K., Switzerland, and Ukraine — secured by the union’s budget.

The 650-million-euro figure is a theoretical maximum amount that member nations could spend on defense over the next four years under new exemptions to the Stability and Growth Pact. The pact itself limits EU nations’ deficits to 3% of GDP. The Rearm plan authorizes the pact’s “escape clause” to increase deficit spending if that deficit spending is on defense, meaning no penalties for member nations expanding their deficit spending.

The Stability and Growth Pact has been in play since the late 90s. But many EU nations regularly run deficits over 3%. Famously, the pact did nothing to prevent the 2010 Euro Crisis, caused by massive public debt taken on by many of the same nations least willing to spend on defense today: Spain, Italy, and Ireland, as well as Greece, whose large defense spending is mostly out of caution about neighboring Turkey. The Stability and Growth Pact’s penalties are rarely enforced and have never resulted in a fine on a member nation.

""The whole ecosystem is fixed and the market is closed, with heavy government influence, with long-term contracts and very difficult procurement.""

""These nations and their defense contractors do not require the EU to tell them that it's okay to rearm,"" Foreman told the Kyiv Independent, quipping, ""It’s great, so now we can doff our caps to Brussels and say, 'Thank you, dear Ursula, for allowing us to spend our own money.'""

The most favorable to the European Union’s proposal will be France and Germany, the EU nations with the largest domestic defense industries, who would therefore be the ultimate recipients of money spent on European-made defense. The rules for Rearm as presented allow manufacturers from the U.K., as well as Ukraine, to participate, but using Rearm funds to buy from non-EU defense contractors will likely draw the ire of the European Commission.

Europe’s traditional defense industries are, however, expensive and heavily regulated. Despite already seeing new orders, there has been a serious lag time in actually increasing production. Yet they remain territorial.

""European militaries are difficult to sell anything to,"" Mikko-Pekka Hanski, a Finnish investor in Ukrainian defense companies. ""The whole ecosystem is fixed and the market is closed, with heavy government influence, with long-term contracts and very difficult procurement.""

Even other European nations fond of arming will be less enthusiastic about sending money to the economies of France and Germany to buy weapons that Gill-Tiney says are more expensive and outdated than their American competitors, largely due to economies of scale.

European defense contractors are, moreover, embedded in their respective national governments and territorial about where their respective militaries send their money. Despite their potential profits, even French support for the broader EU plan is in question.

""It looks likely that either we will have a relatively far-right or far-left president of France, and that either way their commitment to arming Ukraine, their commitment to NATO, will be weaker than under Macron,"" said Gill-Tiney.

Meanwhile, Ukraine is mentioned by name as an acceptable non-EU participant in Rearm Europe. But Ukrainian export barriers mean that during wartime, Ukrainian producers, while eager to be the defense industrial base for Europe, have been sequestered. They also fear that the urgency to stockpile will leave Europe if a ceasefire halts Russia’s active, violent invasion in Ukraine.

League of nations

The history of the European Union is not rich in quick, decisive action, military or otherwise. The EU often deliberately precludes decisiveness. Aside from the formation of a prosperous trading bloc, the EU’s greatest historical success is that none of its members have ever gone to war with each other, in contrast to the preceding millennium of European history.

Long before Trump, the U.S. harangued Europe to provide for more of its own defense. But member nations’ low spending levels are a historical novelty. Prior to 1990, France and Germany spent well over 2% of their GDPs on defense, with the U.K. standing at 4%. Indeed, in the 1960s, even Italy reached 3%, while the U.K. was at 7%. Those figures collapsed along with the Berlin Wall and the fall of the USSR.

NATO nations 20 years ago agreed on a benchmark of 2% of GDP for defense spending, despite commentators often treating that figure as a unilateral U.S. demand on European allies. While Russia’s invasion has added urgency, nations furthest away from Russia fall far short. Ireland spends less than a quarter of a percent.

That failure to meet past defense commitments casts doubts on ongoing grand plans to get NATO members up to 5%, says Gill-Tiney.

""The real issue for a lot of European states is that they agreed to spend 2%, or the NATO members agreed to spend 2%. And many of them then just didn't follow through with their own agreement. The fact that European states actually agreed to and didn't do it, I think is particularly problematic, or was problematic.""

""The investments in Ukraine and in European countries’ defense sector show us that the full-scale invasion created a new market.""

Less militarized EU members have already put up barriers to the latest plan for rearmament. Put off by the militarism, and a comfortable distance from Russia, Spain and Italy managed to get the entire plan renamed in its infancy from “Rearm” to “Readiness,” though even official channels are still referring to the plan under both names.

""They renamed it because they don't want to spend it all on arms, they said, 'We want to spend it on arms and soft power,'"" as Foreman described it. ""This is a very classic Eurofudge, from the Spain that only spends 1.1% of its GDP on defense. They are notorious laggards. And as soon as the idea comes up, they say, 'We will go spend this money on ourselves. We’re not facing Russia's border.'""

Persuading European voters that their money is well-spent on weapons rather than roads and schools is much harder without an immediate threat. And some European governments are quietly hedging for a ceasefire, say experts and industry stakeholders who spoke to the Kyiv Independent.

Leaderboard

Various EU member nations have individually expanded their defense budgets enormously.

Under recently elected Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Germany has emerged as the largest spender in the EU.

Most new German resources are heading for local stalwarts of defense. Rheinmetall, the country’s largest weapons maker, has seen its stock rise tenfold on the Deutsche Börse — a growth figure familiar among tech unicorns but unheard of in an established company, especially one making physical products largely dependent on a market of government contracts.

The high profile of new technologies like drones and electronic warfare has also given rise to a whole new generation of defense contractors in Europe.

""Europe has now understood: It’s not solving the problem of Russia and Ukraine,"" said Kruck. ""It’s solving the topic of how Europe wants to be and how Europe wants to defend itself.""

""The investments in Ukraine and in European countries' defense sector show us that the full-scale invasion created a new market,"" says Hanski. ""And parliament members in England or Sweden are now saying, 'How do we get growth in our country?' So many are thinking that security is the growth sector.""

But the tightest correlation to increasing defense spending remains proximity to Russia, like Hanski’s native Finland. Serving in the Finnish military in 1994, in the trough of European disarmament, Hanski recalls that exercises were always directed at a prospective invasion from the east.

Even the fastest timelines Europe could manage — for example, a Rheinmetall ammunition plant set to open in Ukraine in the middle of 2026, barring delays — may be too late to help Ukraine in the current phase of the war. Ukrainians are keen to warn that the EU is next on the chopping block.

""We are trying to help Europe actually wake up,"" as Mariia Berlinska, head of volunteer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) supplier Victory Drones, put it at a recent panel discussion in Kyiv.

""But I don’t know if they are processing the fact that while this maniac (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is concentrating on us, they have time to ready themselves. Because sooner or later, this demented maniac is going to turn to them.""

Russia has tripled its projected budget deficit for 2025 amid a sharp drop in oil revenues, driven by Western sanctions and plunging crude prices, President Volodymyr Zelensky's commissioner for sanctions policy, Vladyslav Vlasiuk, said on May 29.

According to Vlasiuk, the Kremlin has recently approved changes to its federal budget, increasing the planned deficit from 1.17 trillion rubles ($14.8 billion) to 3.8 trillion rubles ($48.3 billion), or from 0.5% to 1.7% of GDP.

""The reasons? Cheaper oil and a strengthening ruble, which together are slashing oil and gas revenues by nearly a quarter — a loss of 2.6 trillion rubles ($33 billion) from the original forecast,"" Vlasiuk wrote in a statement. He pointed to a revised price forecast for Russia's Urals crude, cut from $69.70 to $56 per barrel.

Reuters reported earlier this month that Urals and ESPO crude blends dropped to $48.90 per barrel — the lowest level in two years and about 40% below the $82.60 price Moscow had initially budgeted for 2025.

Vlasiuk said international sanctions remain a key driver behind the decline in Russia's energy revenues. ""Sanctions against Russia are working,"" he said. ""This is confirmed by many indicators, and we are grateful for all the work that has already been done.""

Ukraine has long been advocating for tighter sanctions against the Russian energy sector, particularly its shadow fleet. Despite hundreds of Russian tankers already under sanctions, many vessels remain operational and continue to ship Russian oil.

""Half of the sanctioned shadow fleet is still functioning,"" Vlasiuk said, calling for expanded measures — including sanctions on Russian ports, terminals, and even individual ship captains.

Russia's energy sector, which provided nearly 30% of the federal budget in early 2024, has been hit by drone strikes from Ukraine and increasing global pressure. The recent plunge in prices followed new tariffs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump on April 7, which spurred fears of a global recession and dragged oil prices to their lowest levels since May 2023.

Speaking on May 5, Trump claimed that Russia had become more willing to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine due to falling oil prices. ""I think Russia, with the price of oil right now, oil has gone down, we are in a good position to settle, they want to settle. Ukraine wants to settle,"" he told reporters.

The financial strain comes as Moscow boosts defense spending by 25% for 2025, raising it to 6.3% of GDP — the highest share since the Cold War. The Kremlin has acknowledged the challenges, with spokesperson Dmitry Peskov calling the global market conditions ""extremely turbulent"" and vowing economic measures to ""minimize the consequences.""

For Ukraine, Vlasiuk said the latest data sends a clear message: ""We are grateful for all the work done so far... But if we want to level up, more needs to be done.""

The U.S. recently blocked a G7 push to lower the $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian oil exports, the Financial Times reported on May 27. The cap, imposed by the G7 and EU in December 2022, bars Western firms from servicing Russian oil sold above that price to limit Moscow's war funding.

While Canada, the EU, and key G7 members supported tightening the cap, the proposal was dropped after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent withheld support. The European Commission had reportedly planned to propose cutting the cap to $50.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1229695804.jpg

In 1953, Polish-American lawyer Raphael Lemkin, the man who coined the term ""genocide,"" wrote a text titled Soviet Genocide in Ukraine. In it, Lemkin spoke not only about the Holodomor — the man-made famine organized in Ukraine by Stalin in 1932–1933 that claimed the lives of around 4 million people — but also about the Kremlin's broader genocidal practices against Ukrainians, which, he argued, had begun as early as the 1920s.

Lemkin wrote that Ukrainians were too numerous to be exterminated entirely in the way Adolf Hitler had attempted with Europe's Jewish population.

""Ukraine is highly susceptible to racial murder by select parts, and so the Communist tactics there have not followed the pattern taken by the German attacks against the Jews,"" the lawyer argued.

He went on to describe how this was carried out: ""The first blow is aimed at the intelligentsia, the national brain, so as to paralyze the rest of the body.... Going along with this attack on the intelligentsia was an attack against the churches, priests and hierarchy, the 'soul' of Ukraine.""

As an example of this attack against the ""soul of the nation,"" Lemkin cited the liquidation of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church and the Ukrainian Catholic Church. ""That Russification was clearly demonstrated by the fact that before its liquidation, the Church was offered the opportunity to join the Russian Patriarchate of Moscow, the Kremlin's political tool,"" he emphasized.

We are bringing back Lemkin's text again today, not for purely historical reasons. It helps explain what the Kremlin is currently doing in the territories of Ukraine it occupies.

We already referenced Soviet Genocide in Ukraine last year. In our investigative documentary Destroy in Whole or in Part, we argued that Russia's current genocidal practices in Ukraine broadly mirror what the Soviet regime has been doing a century back.

Our latest investigative documentary, No God but Theirs, which has just been released, compels us to revisit Lemkin's analysis once more.

This investigation examines the systematic persecution of Ukrainian Christians in Melitopol — a city in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Oblast, occupied by Russia since February 2022. It tells the story of churches (Protestant and Catholic alike) being banned, stripped of all property, and of priests and congregants being arrested, interrogated, and exiled.

While restrictions on religious freedoms are typical for Russia, the persecution in the occupied parts of Ukraine goes far beyond what occurs inside Russia itself.

And these persecutions indeed resemble an attack on the ""soul of the nation"" — precisely the kind Lemkin described.

It is an attack on Christians who, at the very outset of Russia's invasion, demonstrated a clear national identity. In response to the arrival of Russian troops and tanks in Melitopol, local believers began gathering daily on the city's central square. Protestants, Catholics, and Orthodox Christians together resisted the Russian occupation through joint prayer for Ukraine.

Moreover, in the chaos created by the Russian occupation, churches became islands of stability and order. Priests and pastors were seen more and more as moral authorities. For the Russians, therefore, to attack those churches in Melitopol meant also to strike against any alternative centers of power.

And the parallels with Lemkin's text do not end there.

Just as a hundred years back, as described by the author of the term ""genocide,"" before simply banning the churches, the Russians attempted to absorb them first.

Pastor Mykhailo Brytsyn of the Grace Baptist Church recounts in our documentary how the Russian troops offered him a chance to publicly support the Russian authorities. Ukrainian Greek Catholic priest Oleksandr Bohomaz tells how agents of Russian security services tried to coerce him into revealing the secrets of his confessional. Pentecostal pastor Dmytro Bodyu describes how, during his imprisonment and interrogations, he was offered the chance to become a Russian informant.

Only after these efforts to convert Ukrainian clergymen in Melitopol into Russian assets had failed did Kremlin representatives decide to simply eliminate them — once again, fully following the model Lemkin described.

And there is another crucial point to highlight.

While restrictions on religious freedoms are typical for Russia, the persecution in the occupied parts of Ukraine goes far beyond what occurs inside Russia itself. This means that in places like occupied Melitopol, Russia is not merely replicating its usual policies — it is crafting a new, much harsher one specifically for Ukrainians.

Given all this, our new investigation of the persecution of Ukrainian Christian churches in Melitopol is a direct continuation of the previous documentary, which laid out the genocidal intent behind Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Because, in line with Raphael Lemkin's deep and nuanced analysis, these persecutions amount to an attack on the Ukrainian nation as a group. An attempt to eradicate the soul of the Ukrainian nation — with the broader aim of destroying the nation in whole or in part.

Ultimately, the story of the persecution of Christians in Melitopol gives yet another reason to finally dare to use, in reference to Russia's actions in Ukraine, the very word that Lemkin coined — genocide.

Former Ukrainian top official Andriy Portnov met in Ukraine with Oleh Tatarov, deputy head of the Presidential Office, and Oleksii Sukhachov, director of the State Bureau of Investigation, days before he was killed in Madrid, Ukrainska Pravda reported on May 29, citing undisclosed sources.

Portnov was shot dead by unidentified attackers outside the American School in Madrid on May 21. Spanish newspaper El Pais reported that two or three people are believed to be involved in the attack, though no arrests have been made so far, and the motive remains unclear.

Portnov served in the administration of pro-Kremlin President Viktor Yanukovych between 2010 and 2014. After the EuroMaidan Revolution, he lived alternately abroad and in Ukraine and was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2021 over allegations that he was involved in corruption.

Four sources confirmed to Ukrainska Pravda that Portnov was in Ukraine between May 17 and 18 and held meetings with senior officials overseeing Ukraine’s law enforcement agencies, including Tatarov and Sukhachov.

The sources said they were unaware of the topics discussed.

Tatarov is the most controversial official in President Volodymyr Zelensky's administration. He was charged with bribery before joining the administration, but the corruption case against him was obstructed by law enforcement agencies and courts and eventually closed.

According to the media outlet's sources, Portnov has recently been seeking ways to have U.S. sanctions against him lifted. He also reportedly gathered information on the activities of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and civil society activists in Ukraine.

The Kyiv Independent submitted official requests for comment to the Presidential Office and the State Bureau of Investigation but did not receive an immediate response.

Portnov led the legal team of then-Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko from 2005 to 2010 and sat in the parliament between 2006 and 2010. After 2010, he became the head of Yanukovych's main judiciary department and deputy head of his administration.

The ex-official left Ukraine for Russia and later Austria after Yanukovych was ousted in the EuroMaidan Revolution in 2014, but returned to Ukraine in 2019. Portnov fled Ukraine again in 2022 after Russia's full-scale invasion broke out, even though the travel ban for military-age men was already in effect.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-26-at-18_08_32-1.png

A so-called ""Trump shock"" has plunged Europe into its deepest crisis since 1945, but also presents an opportunity for the continent to forge a ""new West,"" British historian and commentator Timothy Garton Ash has said in an interview with the Kyiv Independent.

The first months of Trump's presidency dispelled any illusions in European capitals that the long-held transatlantic partnership would hold firm no matter who sits in the White House.

Washington has signaled reduced military presence in Europe and slashed funding for vital programs promoting democracy and human rights across the continent, putting the U.S.'s role as the leader of the free world in doubt.

Amid perhaps the greatest challenge to Europe's security, Trump also seems to be washing his hands of the Russia-Ukraine war without even attempting to exert additional pressure on Moscow or boost Kyiv's fighting chance.

The ""Trump shock"" is only accumulating the security challenges facing Europe in what may be its deepest crisis since World War II, Ash told the Kyiv Independent during an interview in Lviv on May 16.

Yet, therein also lies an opportunity for European leaders to forge a ""new West"" that would preserve what's left of the liberal world order amid rising authoritarianism and populism, he adds.

Reflecting on world events since his last interview with the Kyiv Independent in May 2024, Ash admits that the U.S. may never be what it was. But, drawing on his background as a historian, he notes that history is full of examples of swings between surging authoritarianism, and a successful liberal fight-back.

Editor's note: The interview has been edited for clarity.

The Kyiv Independent: Last time we talked, you said that we are at the beginning of a new era, and our first steps are going to shape what this new era looks like. One year later, Donald Trump has been elected U.S. president, he jump started major changes in the global security order, Russia's war against Ukraine continues, and populism is rising across Europe. How would you evaluate these first steps of the new era?

Timothy Garton Ash: The triple shock: the Putin shock, what I call the Xi Jinping shock, and now the Trump shock means that we are in the deepest crisis Europe has been in for a very long time, in some respects, since 1945.

But it also means that we all know that in Europe.

Last Friday (May 9), while Xi Jinping and President Lula (of Brazil) and (Prime Minister) Robert Fico of Slovakia were sitting with Vladimir Putin on Red Square, EU foreign ministers were sitting in the Lviv City Hall just up the road to show their solidarity with Ukraine.

And then (French) President Emmanuel Macron, (German) Chancellor Friedrich Mertz, (U.K.) Prime Minister Starmer and (Polish Prime Minister Donald) Tusk were in Kyiv.

So the crisis has become deeper, but the possibility that Europe might seize the opportunity of the crisis is also more apparent.

The Kyiv Independent: Since the end of World War II, the U.S. has cast itself as a leader of the free world. Would you say that it is now abandoning this role? And if so, why now?

Timothy Garton Ash: Excellent question. I think there's no doubt at all that Donald Trump is not the leader of the free world, whatever that means, and that the West as a geopolitical actor does not exist today in the way we've assumed it existed for the last 80 years. And that is a result of two different things: America and Trump.

There's a long-term trend of the United States becoming less committed to and less engaged in Europe, which started already after the end of the Cold War. It was happening under the Democrats and under the Republicans. It's turning either to what (Barack) Obama called nation-building at home, or the pivot to Asia.

""United States will never again be what it was before.""

Then you have the Trump factor, which is this extreme narcissistic bully who obviously has a special relationship with Vladimir Putin and who is abandoning the notion of the United States as a defender of the liberal international order and basically positioning the United States as one transactional great power amongst many.

What does that mean? It means we have a really urgent challenge for the four years of Trump, but we also have a long-term challenge because the United States will never again be what it was before.

The Kyiv Independent: If the U.S. abandons this role and the era of the U.S.-led unipolar world ends, how will the new global security order look?

Timothy Garton Ash: First of all, we never really had a unipolar world. Even the U.S.-led liberal international order was only a large part of the world. It worked because the United States was what the Princeton scholar John Ikenberry calls a ""Liberal Leviathan.""

The Supreme Allied Commander Europe of NATO was always a U.S. general. We had the U.S. nuclear guarantee for our security in Europe. We certainly had a U.S. security order in Europe, in significant parts of Asia and in Oceania, Australia, New Zealand.

That's what's now in question. So I believe that if we are to preserve what's left of the liberal international order, which is not a great deal, it's up to us as Europeans, but also other liberal democratic partners.

""The forces of integration and disintegration in Europe are quite finely balanced at the moment.""

Suddenly, Canada becomes much more important to us. Australia becomes important to us. Japan becomes important to us. In other words, there's a whole new constellation of liberal international order — if you like, a new West.

The Kyiv Independent: What is Europe's role in the era of weakening transatlantic relations, of rising authoritarianism around the world?

Timothy Garton Ash: First of all, our role is to defend ourselves and to look after what we've achieved in Europe over the last 80 years. That means defending ourselves against external enemies or challenges. Obviously, Vladimir Putin's Russia in the first place, but also China in a different way, and other powers.

Secondly, it would be to try and preserve at least some elements of what we call the liberal international order — for example, a free trading world, an international economic order. The EU is a regulatory superpower. Can we preserve some of those shared regulations around the world?

The Kyiv Independent: How would you evaluate Europe's response so far to these new shocks, specifically to the shock of the Trump administration?

Timothy Garton Ash: I think the political will at the top is now there. The question is capability. Just in purely military terms, there's a short list of things that only the United States can provide — the intelligence, the Patriot interceptor missiles, the strategic enablers.

Beyond that, the political will may be there at the top in Europe, but can our leaders continue to persuade their publics through a whole series of national elections that this is the course we should stick to? We have Viktor Orban as the veto player in Hungary. We have Robert Fico in Slovakia.

Very soon, we will probably have a nationalist president of Romania (The interview took place on May 16, before far-right George Simion was defeated in the Romanian presidential election by pro-EU Nicusor Dan).

According to the current opinion polls, Mr. (Andrej) Babis will probably come back (to power) in the Czech Republic. So suddenly, you've got a whole group of countries that want a very different Ukraine policy and Russia policy.

The Kyiv Independent: How can Europe avoid sliding into populism? How can the continent avoid falling into the same trap as the U.S.?

Timothy Garton Ash: I would say the forces of integration and disintegration in Europe are quite finely balanced at the moment.

We have to be tough on populism and tough on the causes of populism. We have to fight the nationalist populist and make a convincing case to our public for a different approach.

But we also have to understand why they continue to get large numbers of votes. For example, the sense that large parts of our societies have been both economically and culturally neglected in the name of liberalism.

And we need to show that we care, we're actually doing something for them economically, that culturally we don't just care about specific minorities in the name of multiculturalism, but we actually care about everyone in our societies.

It's pretty tough to do those two things at the same time, and also build up our defense spending and our support for Ukraine.

The Kyiv Independent: In your book, Homelands, you talk about different definitions of Europe. You say that some European nations that went through dictatorships see Europe as a sort of community of democratic, liberal ideals that they seek to return to. And that's certainly true for Ukraine, as we've seen during the EuroMaidan Revolution. But if Europe and the West are indeed moving away from these ideals, how will that impact Ukraine's path toward democracy?

Timothy Garton Ash: There's always been an anti-liberal Europe, as well as a liberal Europe throughout European history. And it's always been a great mistake to believe that the liberal Europe has prevailed once and for all. By the way, there are also liberal and anti-liberal forces in Ukraine, let's make no mistake about that.

The two things are intimately connected. It's very difficult to imagine Ukraine making a successful transition to a prosperous, sovereign, democratic European future if Europe is disintegrating next door. It's quite difficult to imagine a successful, liberal, democratic, integrated Europe if Ukraine is disintegrating next door.

Both because of the security and migration challenges, but also because we have, in a way, staked our European reputation now on Ukraine. European integration and Ukrainian integration, or European disintegration and Ukrainian disintegration.

But this won't be decided in the next few months. I would say, let's talk again towards the end of the 2020s, and we'll see which tendencies have prevailed.

The Kyiv Independent: Since we are obviously heading toward even more challenging times, can history give us hope or teach us lessons about how democracy can persevere under these challenges?

Timothy Garton Ash: It's going to give us both hope and warnings.

The warning is that just when everybody takes things for granted, they start going wrong. The analogy there would be Europe before 1914. In a way, Europe — certainly before 2014, but arguably up to 2022 — was assuming that it would just be more peaceful summers.

The hope is that we already have examples of successful liberal fightback. The Polish (2023 parliamentary) election is a classic example of a (country) which had nearly gone in the direction of Hungary and an electoral-authoritarian, non-liberal regime, and then it came back.

The larger lesson is that you have these wave movements in history. We had what I would call a liberal democratic revolution across Europe and much of the world from the early 1970s to the 2000s. Now we have an anti-liberal counter-revolution. But with time, people start discovering that that doesn't deliver either.

In fact, it delivers even less. And if you look at the enormous demonstrations in Serbia, large demonstrations in Hungary in support of an opposition candidate, and in Turkey after the imprisonment of Mr. (Ekrem) Imamoglu, you see that the fightback also comes from the countries that have gone authoritarian.

Editor's note: The story was updated to reflect comments made by Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and reporting by Welt.

Germany has unveiled a military aid package for Ukraine worth 5 billion euros ($5.65 billion), the country's Defense Ministry said in a statement on May 28 after Chancellor Friedrich Merz and President Volodymyr Zelensky met in Berlin.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius and Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov signed the accord in Berlin's Bendlerblock, the headquarters of the German Defense Ministry. The agreement includes direct German investments in Ukraine's defense industry and a broader treaty between Kyiv and German arms manufacturers.

Under the new agreement, Germany will help fund the production of long-range weapons systems inside Ukraine — tapping into the country's existing industrial capacities and technical expertise, the statement read.

The German Defense Ministry said a significant number of these systems are expected to be manufactured by the end of 2025, with the first batch ready for deployment in the coming weeks. Since these systems are already in service with the Ukrainian military, no additional training is needed for their use.

Berlin also reaffirmed its commitment to supply Ukraine with critical ammunition and weapons. The arms heading Kyiv's way include air defense systems, artillery, land weapons systems, and handguns. No Taurus missiles were publicly announced as part of the package.

Germany has declined to provide additional details on the package's content, in line with its new information security policy regarding arms supplies to Ukraine.

The German newspaper Welt reported that the package includes about 400 million euros ($450 million) for the production of Ukrainian long-range BARS and AN-196 drones and Flamingo interceptor drones.

The package further contains four IRIS-T air defense systems and funding for contracts for the repair of military vehicles in Ukraine, namely Gepard air defenses. Berlin also pledged to help finance the operations of the Starlink satellite communications system in Ukraine.

""Germany has committed to supporting investment in the Ukrainian defense industry and encouraging others to do the same, particularly in the area of air defense,"" Umerov said on social media after the agreement was announced. ""Sincere thanks to our partners for their leadership and consistent support of Ukraine in resisting Russian aggression.""

The meeting between Merz and Zelensky in Berlin was preceded by speculation that Germany would finally reverse its long-held policy of not sending Taurus missiles to Kyiv over fears of escalating the war against Russia.

Before becoming chancellor, Merz, elected for the CDU/CSU conservative alliance, signaled he would overturn a ban imposed by his predecessor, Social Democrat Olaf Scholz.

Ukraine has been using U.S.-made ATACMS for over a year, and U.K.-French Storm Shadows for more than two.

Only in late 2024, the Biden administration and other allies eased the restrictions, allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles against Russian military targets on Russian territory.

In range, speed, and payload, Taurus much resembles the Storm Shadow, which is made by Taurus’ manufacturer, MBDA’s French affiliate.

The primary distinction for Taurus is in the design of the actual warhead — Taurus can be programmed to explode after hitting a specific target, such as a bunker.

The missile can penetrate and actually count layers before the final explosion, maximizing damage.

Taurus would represent a major upgrade to Ukraine’s deep-strike firepower, primarily because it can blast through denser Russian fortifications. It would also help in Ukraine's years-long quest to take down the Crimean Bridge.

As part of the new agreement, the two nations have also agreed to establish repair facilities in Ukraine to improve the sustainability of its armed forces. Defense firms from both countries are expected to form joint ventures to manage these operations.

Berlin will also continue funding satellite communications and military leadership communication systems, extending a commitment first made in April. Additional medical aid, including equipment produced in Ukraine, will be financed as part of the agreement.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/zeichnung-rustem-umerov-und-boris-pistorius.jpg

The Ukrainian ombudsman stressed that Hrishchenkov's disappearance is ""not an isolated case,"" with other people being kidnapped by alleged FSB officers.

Ukraine will not take part in the World Judo Championships set for June in Budapest due to Belarus’s participation in the competition, the Ukrainian Judo Federation announced on May 29.

The decision came after the Executive Committee of the International Judo Federation (IJF) confirmed, following an appeal from Kyiv, that Belarusian athletes are allowed to take part in all international competitions under national symbols from June 1, 2025.

Since the outbreak of Moscow's full-scale war, Ukraine has repeatedly called for a ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes from participating in international competitions, including the 2024 Paris Olympics. Ultimately, these athletes were allowed to compete only as ""individual neutral athletes"" in individual disciplines without using any national symbols related to their countries.

While Belarus, an ally of Russia, has not directly participated in the war, it has allowed the Kremlin to use its territory as a staging ground for its operations against Ukraine.

According to the Ukrainian committee, the federation said in its response that ""the IJF is committed to ensuring that sport serves as a platform for dialogue, unity, and understanding — building bridges, not walls.""

The Ukrainian Judo Federation condemned the decision, saying that it contradicts ""the fundamental principles of fairness, responsibility, and solidarity in the global sports movement.""

""We firmly believe that allowing athletes from aggressor countries to compete under national symbols is not only a case of political blindness but also a blatant disregard for the victims of war and international law,"" the statement read.

A building was reportedly damaged on the outskirts of Moscow following a Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian capital overnight on May 29, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin reported.

This marks the second consecutive day of attacks on Moscow Oblast, with multiple industrial facilities targeted by Ukrainian drones and several unmanned aircraft reportedly downed on approach to the capital on May 28.

Videos and photos posted on social media by residents purportedly show damage sustained by a residential building on Vernadsky Avenue in Southwest Moscow. Explosions were heard in the area around 1:40 a.m. local time.

Sobyanin claimed that no one was injured in the attack that occurred as a result of falling drone debris. He added that the crew is currently on-scene, inspecting the damage.

The full extent of the damage was not immediately clear. Ukraine's military has not commented on the reported attack.

Russian air defenses shot down 48 Ukrainian drones overnight, including three over Moscow Oblast, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed.

The Kyiv Independent cannot independently verify reports or claims made by Russian officials.

The previous night on May 28, Russian air defenses shot down 296 Ukrainian drones across multiple regions overnight, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed, potentially marking one of the heaviest drone attacks against Russia during the full-scale war.

As Russia continues to reject calls for a ceasefire and the war drags on, Ukraine has intensified drone attacks on Russian territory. In particular, drone attacks in Russia have forced airport closures for several nights in a row.

NATO wants Germany to contribute seven more brigades, or roughly 40,000 troops, to boost collective defense against Russia, Bloomberg and Reuters reported on May 28, citing their sources.

The news comes amid mounting tensions between the alliance and Russia and an increasingly uncertain U.S. commitment to European security.

The alliance's overall demand for the number of brigades provided by member states could go from 80 to between 120 and 130, an undisclosed senior official told Reuters.

Germany agreed to provide 10 brigades to NATO by 2030. It currently fields nine brigades — each comprising around 5,000 soldiers — including one new formation stationed in Lithuania.

Though no firm date for implementing the changes has been set, 2030 has been mentioned as a preferred deadline, Bloomberg reported.

Allied defense ministers are expected to discuss the matter during a meeting in Brussels next week.

Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 prompted European countries to hike defense spending in order to revive their military capabilities, which atrophied after decades of disarmament following the Cold War.

The matter gained more urgency after signals that the U.S., the most powerful military in NATO, plans to scale down its presence in Europe as President Donald Trump shifts strategic focus to the Asia-Pacific region.

Beginning overnight on Saturday, May 24, Russia rained down nearly a thousand drones and missiles on villages and cities across Ukraine in three nights of large-scale aerial attacks, as civilians spent hours sheltering underground.

Russia’s bombardment killed more than a dozen people and injured dozens more, in one of the largest coordinated attacks since the start of the war.

Such deadly storms of drones and missiles are not cheap to carry out, but the costs of these weapons are sensitive military information that Russia keeps classified.

Experts and media outlets have estimated that attacks like the one this past weekend cost Russia hundreds of thousands of dollars in weaponry. The estimated figures vary significantly, however, and that's before adding in other costs beyond their price tag, like the price of a flight that launches a missile, or storage costs before weapons are used.

""The cost of these large strikes is quite difficult to estimate in the open-source because Russia goes to great lengths to obfuscate the cost of the missiles and drones,"" said Angelica Evans, a Russia analyst with the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

""Particularly with the onset of western sanctions and Russia's many sanctions evasion schemes, it's difficult to know how much all of the various components in the projectiles really cost, let alone the cost of production itself.""

What weapons were used in the recent attack?

According to Ukraine’s Air Force, the weekend attack used Shahed drones, decoy drones, three types of cruise missiles, and Iskander-M and KN-23 ballistic missiles.

Most of the 995 weapons — 903 of them — were Shahed kamikaze drones or decoy drones meant to mimic the behavior of Shaheds and overwhelm air defense systems.

Russia also launched 69 cruise missiles: 64 of the Kh-101 variety, 4 Kh-59/69 missiles, and one Kh-22 missile.

The remaining 23 weapons were Iskander-M ballistic missiles or similar North Korean KN-23 ballistic missiles.

How much do the weapons cost?

Some experts have tried to come up with price tags for different weapons systems using open-source information, including examining the components of downed weaponry, comparing missiles to similar weapons in the West, and analyzing hacked procurement contract data.

While these methods can give a better sense of how much Russia is paying to carry out its aerial attacks, they result in a range rather than a hard figure.

Take the Shahed, for example. One commonly cited figure is $50,000 per Shahed drone produced in Russia. Others have said the scaling of production in the past year within Russia has lowered the cost, potentially as low as $20,000.

Hacked documents between Russia and Iran, meanwhile, show that Russia negotiated prices for Iranian-made Shaheds earlier in the war in the range of $193,000 to $290,000 per unit, depending on the number ordered. To save money on drones, Russia is increasingly producing them at home. Satellite imagery has detected the expansion of the facilities where Shahed drones are manufactured in Russia.

The cost of a Shahed used by Russia therefore heavily depends on when it was acquired and whether you’re calculating its replacement cost or its original purchase or production price.

Nor do these estimates account for modifications made to the drones by Russians in the field or at the unit level. Another consideration is whether to include the cost of paying the soldiers who deploy the weapon.

""Recent reporting estimates Russia can produce roughly 100 Shaheds per day.""

The uncertainty is multiplied hundreds of times over for each drone in a major attack.

But the use of decoy drones provides another complication in calculating the cost of the recent Russian attack: How many of the 903 drones were Shaheds, and how many were the much cheaper decoy drones?

Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Service believes the most expensive part of the decoy drones is their engine, which can be bought online for around $350–$500. A complete decoy is likely to cost in the low thousands range.

Yurii Ihnat, a Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson, has stated that almost half of the deployed drones may be decoys.

And these are only considerations for pricing a drone. Missiles have a heftier price tag — from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars per missile — and can also come with a wider price range.

Stockpiling for 'rarer but more intense strikes'

Most ballpark estimates would put a dollar price tag in the high six figures for the recent three-day aerial attack, but the usefulness of such a metric is limited by how much variability there is.

A more helpful metric, said Evans of ISW, would be looking at how many weapons are being launched compared to how many weapons Russia can produce.

Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged to continue scaling up production of weapons, and drones in particular, calling them a major factor in combat successes.

""We have seen recent reporting that Russia has been increasing its ability to produce Shahed drones and decoy variants for many months, and recent reporting estimates Russia can produce roughly 100 Shaheds per day,"" Evans said.

This suggests that the drones used in the past weekend's attack could be replenished in just over a week.

""Russian missile production capabilities are much more limited, particularly of Iskander ballistic missiles, and the Russians may be trying to stockpile cruise missiles so they can conduct rarer but more intense strike series like we saw over the weekend,"" Evans added.

The upcoming Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting in the Ramstein format will be held on June 4 in Brussels under the chairmanship of the U.K. and Germany, NATO announced on May 29.

The Ramstein summit will take place as Washington is trying to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia to end Moscow's full-scale war.

In the meantime, Russia is amassing forces for a new offensive against Ukraine while continuing its attacks on civilians across the country, straining Ukrainian air defenses.

The last Ramstein-format UDCG meeting took place in Brussels on April 11 under the chairmanship of London and Berlin — a position previously held by the U.S.

Leadership over Ramstein transitioned following the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

During the previous meeting, NATO allies committed more than 21 billion euros ($23.8 billion) in long-term military aid to Ukraine.

The move came amid growing uncertainty over U.S. support for Ukraine and efforts by European allies to close the gap as Kyiv resists Russia's ongoing war.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2096199937.jpg

Russia has concentrated a sufficient amount of forces in Kursk Oblast to potentially launch an attack on Ukraine’s Sumy Oblast, State Border Guard Service spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said on May 29.

The statement comes amid warnings of a new possible Russian offensive this summer as U.S.-mediated peace efforts have failed to produce a ceasefire deal.

Russia has become increasingly active in Sumy Oblast after mostly pushing out Ukrainian forces from Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian authorities recently confirmed that Russian forces captured four Sumy Oblast villages close to the border: Novenke, Zhuravka, Veselivka, and Basivka.

Speaking on national television, Demchenko said Russia began amassing forces when it attempted to push Ukrainian troops out of Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched its operation in August 2024.

Russia continues to maintain a force in Kursk Oblast, and Ukraine periodically detects a ""certain change in the number of both soldiers and equipment in this area,"" the spokesperson said.

Russia ""has enough forces there (in Kursk Oblast) to carry out operations against our border and attempt to attack the territory of Ukraine,"" he continued.

The remarks came days after President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia is accumulating 50,000 troops near Ukraine's northeastern Sumy Oblast, seeking to create a 10-kilometer buffer zone in the area.

According to Kyiv, Russia planned to launch an offensive into Sumy Oblast already back in 2024, but the plan was disrupted by Ukraine's incursion into Kursk Oblast.

Russian-linked hackers targeted U.K. Defense Ministry staff in an espionage operation while posing as journalists, Sky News reported on May 29, citing the British government.

The cyber attack was detected and thwarted, the government said.

Earlier this month, London accused Russia's military intelligence (GRU) of a cyber campaign targeting Western logistics and technology organizations involved in delivering foreign assistance to Ukraine.

Similarly, the French Foreign Ministry accused a GRU-linked hacker unit of escalating cyberattacks against French ministries.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov presented to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio Moscow's ""specific proposals"" for the next round of peace talks with Ukraine, Russia's Foreign Ministry announced on May 29.

The two diplomats held a phone call on May 28, the day when Russia proposed holding negotiations with Ukraine in Istanbul on June 2 in a follow-up to the first round on May 16.

Lavrov also ""informed Marco Rubio about implementing the May 19 agreements between President of Russia Vladimir Putin and President of the United States Donald Trump,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said.

Trump and Putin held a phone call on May 19, during which the Russian leader again rejected a truce and pushed for maximalist demands, but also voiced his readiness to negotiate a ""memorandum regarding a potential future peace treaty.""

During the call with Lavrov, Rubio stressed Trump's ""intention to quickly bring the Ukraine conflict to an end and expressed Washington's readiness to help the sides to bring their positions closer together,"" according to the Russian readout.

While initially reluctant to criticize Putin, Trump adopted an increasingly critical tone toward the Russian leader in recent days as Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities intensify and the Kremlin continues to reject calls for a ceasefire.

Kyiv and its European partners have urged the U.S. to impose additional sanctions to pressure Moscow to agree to a truce. Trump has refused to take the step so far, saying he is ""close to getting a deal"" and does not want to ""screw it up"" by fresh sanctions.

""We're going to find out very soon. It'll take about two weeks, or a week and a half,"" Trump told reporters this week, responding to a question on whether Putin wants to end the war. He added that Washington would ""respond a little bit differently"" if it appears that Moscow is stalling.

""They seem to want to do something. But until the document is signed, I can't tell you... I'm very disappointed at what happened. A couple of nights now where people were killed in the middle of what you would call a negotiation.""

Russia vowed to present its peace memorandum but has yet to deliver, drawing rebuke from Ukrainian, European, and U.S. officials. Trump has also repeatedly signaled he would exit the peace efforts unless progress is achieved soon.

Reuters reported that Putin's conditions for ending Russia's war against Ukraine include a written pledge by NATO not to accept more Eastern European members, lifting of some sanctions, and Ukraine's neutral status, among other demands.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2199658460.jpg

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on May 28 that a potential delivery of Taurus cruise missiles for Ukraine is not being ruled out.

""Of course, that's within the realm of possibility,"" Merz said on air on ZDF TV channel when asked about the possibility of Taurus deliveries for Kyiv.

The chancellor nevertheless emphasized that using the missiles would require a lengthy training period, potentially taking ""several months of training for soldiers in Ukraine.""

The comments come after Merz hosted President Volodymyr Zelensky in Berlin on May 28. During the visit, the German government announced 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) in new military assistance and financial support for the Ukrainian long-range missiles program.

Merz made no new announcements about a delivery of Taurus missiles. Zelensky's visit was accompanied by fresh speculations about a possible policy reversal, as Merz declared earlier this week that Germany and other Western partners have lifted all range restrictions on arms provided to Kyiv.

The chancellor later clarified he was referring to a decision made ""many months ago.""

Talking to ZDF, Merz said that a delivery within six months or a year would be of no use to Ukraine today, which is why Berlin is focusing on improving Ukraine's current military position.

Before becoming chancellor, Merz, elected for the CDU/CSU conservative alliance, signaled he would overturn the ban of his predecessor, Social Democrat Olaf Scholz, on delivering Taurus to Ukraine.

The Taurus is a powerful cruise missile capable of striking targets at a distance of 500 kilometers (300 miles), more than the long-range capabilities Ukraine received from other partners.

Ukraine has been using U.S.-made ATACMS for over a year, and U.K.-French Storm Shadow/SCALP for more than two, initially being allowed to deploy them only against Russian targets on Ukrainian territory.

Only in late 2024, the Biden administration and other allies eased the restrictions, allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles against Russian military targets on Russian territory.

In range, speed, and payload, Taurus much resembles the Storm Shadow, which is made by Taurus’ manufacturer, MBDA’s French affiliate. The primary distinction for Taurus is in the design of the actual warhead — Taurus can be programmed to explode after hitting a specific target, such as a bunker.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2216854661.jpg

An explosion in Russia’s Stavropol on May 28 killed Zaur Gurtsyev, the city's deputy mayor who participated in Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine.

Stavropol Krai Governor Vladimir Vladimirov confirmed Gurtsyev’s death, describing it as a ""nighttime incident on Chekhov Street"" without providing further details.

The Investigative Committee of Russia reported that the bodies of two men with multiple injuries were found at the scene.

Multiple Russian Telegram channels identified Gurtsyev as one of the victims and shared what they claimed was footage of the explosion.

Telegram and Elon Musk's xAI will enter a one-year partnership, integrating the Grok chatbot into the messaging app, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov announced on May 28.

Musk, the world's richest man who also owns Tesla and SpaceX, commented that ""no deal has been signed,"" prompting Durov to clarify that the deal has been agreed in ""principle"" with ""formalities pending.""

""This summer, Telegram users will gain access to the best AI technology on the market,"" Durov said.

""Elon Musk and I have agreed to a one-year partnership to bring xAI’s chatbot Grok to our billion+ users and integrate it across all Telegram apps.""

The announcement comes as Musk announces his exit from his role in the Trump administration to focus on his business ventures, many of which saw their profits drop in the past few months.

Musk founded xAI in 2023, and earlier this year, another of his ventures, X Corp., which operates the X social platform, acquired the AI company. Grok is xAI's flagship project and has already been integrated into X.

Musk's takeover of X saw the social platform, formerly known as Twitter, become the leading source of disinformation, EU officials said. The Grok chatbot also faced scrutiny recently after posting unprompted comments on the topic of so-called ""white genocide"" in South Africa, Musk's home country.

Durov, the Russian-born founder of Telegram, currently resides in Dubai and holds Russian, Emirati, and French citizenship. He is under investigation in France for criminal activity on his messaging app.

Durov has claimed he is a pariah and has been effectively exiled from Russia, but it was reported last year that he had visited Russia over 60 times since leaving the country, according to Kremlingram, a Ukrainian group that campaigns against the use of Telegram in Ukraine.

Telegram remains one of the most popular social media platforms among Ukrainians. A September 2023 poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology indicated that 44% of Ukrainians use Telegram to receive information and news.

A U.S. federal court overturned on May 28 President Donald Trump's tariffs on dozens of countries, including those affecting trade with Ukraine, according to the U.S. Court of International Trade's ruling.

Trump announced a new sweeping tariff policy on April 2 as part of what he called ""Liberation Day,"" framing the tariff regime as a bid to revitalize U.S. manufacturing and fight back against foreign exploitation.

Ukraine was hit with a 10% blanket tariff on its exports, lower than the 20% imposed on the European Union. Increased rates targeted countries where the U.S. has the largest trade deficits, notably China.

Russia, Belarus, North Korea, and Cuba were not included.

The court ruled that the federal law allowing the president to impose tariffs, embargoes, and sanctions during national emergencies ""does not authorize the president to impose unbounded tariffs.""

The ruling cited the U.S. Constitution, saying that it grants Congress sole authority over international trade, which is not superseded by the president’s emergency economic powers.

The court struck down the 10% tariffs applied to all U.S. trading partners to address the trade deficit, along with Trump’s proposed ""reciprocal"" tariffs of 20–50% on over 60 countries. This move means that the court would also block tariffs on trade with Ukraine.

Additionally, the court overturned Trump’s executive orders imposing 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods and a 20% tariff on Chinese goods.

A 10% blanket tariff on its exports was still a setback for a country at war. Kyiv's metallurgy sector, a major source of Ukrainian exports to the U.S., was already impacted by a 25% tariff imposed in March.

In 2023, Ukrainian exports to the U.S. totaled just $874 million, while imports from the U.S. reached $3.4 billion. The overall trade volume has declined in recent years, but the tariffs could deepen the imbalance, especially if they trigger broader protectionist measures globally.

Elon Musk announced on May 29 that his time as a special government employee in the Trump administration is coming to an end, thanking U.S. President Donald Trump for the ""opportunity to reduce wasteful spending.""

The billionaire, who oversaw the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) massive layoffs and cuts across government agencies, said the department's mission will continue.

""The DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government,"" Musk wrote on his social platform X.

The later days of Musk's 130-day tenure, which is set to conclude on May 30, were accompanied by growing tensions between the world's richest man and senior members of the Trump administration, reportedly including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

Musk also criticized a massive Trump-backed domestic policy bill passed by the Republicans in the House of Representatives last week, saying the legislation ""increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.""

A White House official confirmed to Reuters that the owner of Tesla, X, and SpaceX is departing the administration. His exit, described as quick and unceremonious, was reportedly decided on a senior staff level and without a conversation with Trump, who previously repeatedly praised the billionaire.

The businessman was one of the most visible figures of Trump's election campaign and the early days of his administration, leading the effort to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.S.'s chief foreign aid agency.

USAID was vital in providing humanitarian relief worldwide and funded thousands of programs supporting human rights, democracy, education, civil society, and infrastructure development.

Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, USAID has provided Ukraine with $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support, helping to rebuild schools after Russian attacks, pay for bomb shelters, advanced medical equipment for hospitals and much more.

Despite massive repercussions for the work of federal agencies and their employees, DOGE's steps were described as falling short of Musk's bold cost-saving ambitions, with the initial goal of saving $2 trillion downgraded to $150 billion.

Musk eventually scaled down his public presence amid dropping popularity ratings and slumping Tesla profits.

The businessman has also been vocal on the Russia-Ukraine war. While initially declaring support for the invaded country and providing his Starlink satellite communications to Ukraine, he gradually adopted pro-Russian and anti-Ukrainian talking points.

Musk spread narratives that President Volodymyr Zelensky has minimal support in the country, despite numerous polls showing otherwise, and accused the Ukrainian president of perpetuating a ""never-ending draft meat grinder.""

Moscow is planning to deploy multiple Oreshnik missile systems to Belarus by the end of 2025, State Secretary of Belarus' Security Council Alexander Volfovich said on May 28.

The ""Oreshnik"" is an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) that Russia touts as an experimental weapon capable of bypassing advanced air defense systems.

In December 2024, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko requested Moscow deploy 10 Russian Oreshnik missile systems in Belarus, pro-Kremlin journalist Alexander Yunashev reported on his Telegram channel.

""The locations for its deployment have already been determined,"" Volfovich said, without specifying how many missile systems would be deployed.

The Kyiv Independent cannot verify claims made by Belarusian officials.

On Nov. 21, 2024, Russia launched an Oreshnik missile against the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. The Oreshnik missile is designed to carry nuclear weapons, however, the missile was not armed with a nuclear warhead during the attack.

Russia launched the Oreshnik missile against Ukraine following Kyiv's first successful use of U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles on a military target in Russia. Moscow later acknowledged additional ATACMS strikes on targets in Kursk and Bryansk oblasts.

While Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed Russia has begun mass production of the Oreshnik, a U.S. official told The Kyiv Independent that Moscow likely possesses ""only a handful"" of these experimental missiles.

Belarus has been a key ally to Moscow and has previously been reported as hosting Russian tactical nuclear arms on its territory, after the two countries signed an agreement in May 2023.

Lukashenko said in December 2023 that the transfer of Russian nuclear weapons to Belarus was completed in early October.

Despite the claims, Ukrainian foreign intelligence chief Oleh Ivashchenko said in an interview with Ukrinform published on May 26 that Belarus possesses nuclear weapon delivery systems but no warheads.

An Avangard electronics plant reportedly caught fire in the Russian city of St. Petersburg following a series of explosions, local Telegram channels and officials reported overnight on May 29.

In purported videos posted on social media, a large fire was seen rising from the factory's roof in the Kalininsky district of the city. Preliminary reports indicate that the fire began around 1 a.m. local time.

The fire is reportedly burning on the 5th floor of a 6-story building, the St. Petersburg Emergency Services Ministry said, adding that the fire covers approximately 100-square-meters.

The plant reportedly specializes in the production of microelectronics and microcircuits.

The cause of the fire was not immediately clear. Ukraine's military has not yet commented on the fire, and there were no official reports of Ukrainian drone attacks targeting the region ahead of the fire.

The Kyiv Independent cannot independently verify reports made by Russian officials.

Kyiv has previously target St. Petersburg through drone attacks on the region.

As Russia continues to reject calls for a ceasefire and the war drags on, Ukraine has intensified drone attacks on Russian territory. In particular, drone attacks in Russia have forced airport closures for several nights in a row.

Approximately 800 remaining full-time Voice of America (VOA) employees are expected to receive a notice of termination this week amid the Trump administration's funding cuts, Politico reported on May 28, citing four VOA employees.

On March 15, Trump administration officials gutted funding for the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees VOA.

In an email obtained by the Kyiv Independent in March, employees at VOA were instructed ""not to enter USAGM premises"" nor ""access USAGM systems."" Over 1,300 journalists, producers and support staff working at VOA were also placed on administrative leave.

A senior VOA employee told Politico that USAGM-led layoffs would likely affect all staff, effectively shuttering operations. Earlier this month on May 15, about 600 contractors working for VOA received termination notices.

VOA was founded in 1942, broadcasting in almost 50 languages around the world.

Amid attempts by journalists to overturn the decision to gut funding, a U.S. federal judge on April 22 ordered the Trump administration to restore all employees and contractors at VOA, saying the administration's efforts to dismantle the outlet likely violated U.S. law.

Last week, a federal appeals court overturned the decision, deciding that it would not intervene in the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the long-standing network.

Trump has long criticized U.S.-funded media organization, criticizing them over their coverage of the U.S. president, and often referring to them as ""fake news.""

Trump's crackdown against VOA has been celebrated by Russian propagandists, who welcomed the cuts to the network.

A total of 1,279 of the approximately 2,500 Azov fighters held in Russian captivity as POWs have been returned to Ukraine since being captured, including 455 from the Azov Brigade, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said on May 28.

The confirmed statistic, which includes soldiers in multiple units who fought to defend the Azovstal Steel Plant in Mariupol, comes amid social media outcry criticizing Ukrainian authorities for failing to return certain captives, including Azov fighters, during the war's largest 1,000-for-1,000 POW exchange, which concluded on May 25.

""Behind each number is a human life, and no statistics can replace loved ones for individual families,"" Andrii Yusov, deputy head of the Coordination Headquarters told Radio Liberty on May 28.

Ukrainian society has rallied for captured Azov fighters who defended the Azovstal Steel Plant in Mariupol during the Russian siege of the port city in 2022. The battle, one of the most brutal of the entire war, is credited with buying time for the Ukrainian Armed Forces to prepare itself and receive international military aid against Russia's invasion during the initial phase of the war.

Azovstal defenders were ordered to surrender to the encircling Russian forces after nearly two months of constant bombardment of the besieged plant. While hundreds of these fighters have been released since 2022, hundreds more remain in captivity.

Colonel Denys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov National Guard Brigade, described the 1,000-for-1,000 exchange as a ""mockery"" due to the lack of fighters from the Azov Brigade, in a post on Facebook on May 25.

""Ukraine is fighting for every one of its citizens. We are working under extremely difficult conditions amid the full-scale invasion, and the Mariupol garrison remains one of the top priorities for repatriation,"" Yusov said on May 25 in response to to the frustration seen on social media.

Ukraine has long advocated for an ""all-for-all"" exchange, but Russia has so far rejected the proposal.

President Volodymyr Zelensky, following the mass exchange, pledged to ""bring back every single one of our people from Russian captivity.""

The three days of prisoner exchanges were negotiated by Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul on May 16th, during the first direct talks between the two countries in three years.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on May 28 that Moscow has proposed June 2 as the date for the next round of talks with Ukraine in Istanbul.

Russian armed forces have committed crimes against humanity by deliberately targeting civilians with drones in Ukraine's Kherson Oblast, according to a new report by the United Nation's Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine.

The commission concluded that the drone attacks, which began in July 2024, were widespread, systematic, and part of a coordinated state policy to terrorize the population and forcibly depopulate the area. The findings were based on more than 300 videos, over 600 Telegram posts, and 91 interviews with victims, witnesses, and local officials.

""From July 2024, Russian forces have recurrently killed and injured civilians in an area stretching over more than 100 kilometres along the right bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson (Oblast),"" the commission said in the report published on May 28.

Nearly 150 civilians have been killed and hundreds more wounded in drone strikes on Kherson city and 16 surrounding localities. Victims include men, women, and children, with many struck while going about their daily routines. Ambulances, which are protected under international law, have also been targeted, resulting in additional casualties.

Drone operators used real-time video feeds to track and strike civilians and civilian vehicles. ""They are simply chasing and hunting civilians who are on their way to work or walking their dogs. They drop explosives from drones like it is a video game,"" a senior Kherson hospital official said. The attacks were often followed by Telegram posts showing the killings and threatening further violence. One message warned, ""Get out of the city before the leaves fall, you who are destined to die.""

The report notes that these attacks violate the core principles of international humanitarian law, which prohibit targeting civilians. The commission concluded that Russian forces committed the war crime of intentionally attacking civilians and the war crime of outrages upon personal dignity by sharing videos of the assaults online. The constant threat has left residents living in fear, often venturing outside only under cloud cover or near trees for safety.

""The recurrent drone attacks, the widely disseminated videos showing them, and numerous posts explicitly exhorting the population to leave suggest a coordinated state policy, on the part of the Russian authorities, to force the population of Kherson Province to leave the area,"" the report said.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1490669517.jpg

U.S. President Donald Trump said on May 28 that he has not yet imposed new sanctions on Russia because he believes a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine may be within reach.

""If I think I'm close to getting a deal, I don't want to screw it up by doing that,"" he told reporters, adding that he is ""much tougher"" than those he is negotiating with.

Trump said the United States would soon learn whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is genuinely interested in ending the war. If it becomes clear that Moscow is stalling, Trump warned, Washington would ""respond a little bit differently.""

CNN reported on May 27 that Trump is weighing new sanctions on Russia after a deadly weekend of missile and drone strikes across Ukraine. Russian forces on May 26 conducted what Ukrainian authorities described as the largest drone attack of the full-scale war, reportedly involving 355 Shahed-type drones and decoys.

During a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 19, Trump was told that a ""memorandum of peace"" outlining conditions for a ceasefire would be delivered shortly. As of May 27, no such document has been received, a U.S. official and a White House source familiar with the matter told CNN.

Responding to a question on whether Putin is serious about peace, Trump said that ""We're going to find out very soon. It'll take about two weeks, or week and a half.""

""They seem to want to do something. But until the document is signed, I can't tell you... I'm very disappointed at what happened. A couple of nights now where people were killed in the middle of what you would call a negotiation.""

Trump added that he would be willing to meet both President Volodymyr Zelensky and President Putin ""if necessary.""

Earlier in the day, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow had proposed a new round of peace talks with Ukraine to be held in Istanbul on June 2.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said that Kyiv is still awaiting the Russian side’s proposed ceasefire memorandum, which was expected following peace talks in Turkey earlier this month.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on May 28 that Kyiv is still awaiting the Russian side’s proposed ceasefire memorandum, which was expected following peace talks in Turkey earlier this month.

According to Umerov, the international community had anticipated Russia would submit the document promptly after the May 16 negotiations in Istanbul.

""Unfortunately, the Russian side attempted to delay this process. But pressure worked,"" Umerov said in his Facebook post. He credited statements from U.S. President Donald Trump, European leaders, and President Volodymyr Zelensky for compelling Moscow to complete the draft. He noted, however, that Russia continues to withhold delivery of the document.

""They received our document,"" Umerov added, referring to Ukraine’s position paper. ""We reaffirm Ukraine’s readiness for a full and unconditional ceasefire and continued diplomatic engagement.""

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced the same day that Russia's memorandum, detailing its stance, would be presented by the delegation led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky during the next round of negotiations set for June 2 in Istanbul.

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha urged Moscow not to delay sending the memorandum.

“If the Russians have finally elaborated on their ‘memorandum’—after ten days of reflections and attacks—it can be passed to us right away,"" Sybiha said on X. ""We anticipate that the Russian side will not derail the next meeting and will immediately submit their proposals for our consideration, as previously agreed.""

During a press conference, Lavrov said the two sides had agreed on May 16 to draft documents outlining their respective positions. He added that Russia had ""promptly drafted a corresponding memorandum,"" which includes what he described as steps to address the ""root causes of the crisis.""

Russia’s so-called ""root causes"" reportedly include long-standing maximalist demands that Kyiv withdraw from four partially occupied regions, that NATO cease further expansion eastward, and that some sanctions on Moscow be lifted. The memorandum also addresses the issue of frozen Russian assets and calls for ""the protection of Russian-speaking Ukrainians.""

Moscow has promoted the narrative that Kyiv discriminates against Russian-speaking citizens through its language policies. While Russian is still widely spoken throughout Ukraine, the government has introduced reforms in recent years aimed at strengthening the use of Ukrainian in public life—part of broader efforts to reverse decades of Russification under both Soviet and Russian influence.

A vast majority of Russian-speaking Ukrainians — those how primarily speak Russian at home — view Russia negatively, according to a survey published on May 27 by Kyiv-based think tank Razumkov Center in cooperation with the Kyiv Security Forum.

Umerov also said Ukraine is open to additional meetings but stressed the importance of preparedness to ensure any discussions are productive.

""The Russian side has at least four more days (until June 2) before their departure to provide us with their document for review,"" he said. ""We call on them to fulfill that promise without delay and stop trying to turn the meeting into a destructive one. Diplomacy must be substantive, and the next meeting must yield results.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1648100666-1.webp

Moscow has proposed June 2 as the date for the next round of talks with Ukraine in Istanbul, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during a press conference.

In his remarks, Lavrov said the talks would be a continuation of the process launched during earlier negotiations on May 16 in Istanbul.

""In Istanbul, it was agreed that Moscow and Kyiv would prepare documents setting out the positions of each side to reach a sustainable resolution,"" Lavrov said. ""The Russian side, as agreed, promptly drafted a corresponding memorandum, which lays out our position on all aspects of reliably overcoming the root causes of the crisis.""

Under the guise of so-called ""root causes,"" Russia has repeatedly reiterated its long-standing maximalist demands of Ukraine — the same ones it has voiced since the start of the full-scale invasion and has used as propaganda to justify its aggression against Ukraine.

Among them, Moscow insists Kyiv withdraw from four partially occupied Ukrainian regions it claims to have annexed.

Russia's memorandum also reportedly includes a written pledge that NATO will not expand further eastward, effectively blocking Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova from joining, as well as the lifting of some Western sanctions, resolution of frozen Russian assets, and ""the protection of Russian-speaking Ukrainians.""

Lavrov added that the Russian delegation, led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, is prepared to present this memorandum to the Ukrainian side and provide necessary clarifications during the second round of negotiations in Istanbul on June 2.

Ukrainian drones hit Russian cruise missile factory, SBU source says, in one of largest reported strikes of full-scale war

Ukrainian long-range drones hit the Raduga enterprise in the town of Dubna in Moscow Oblast, which produces cruise missiles, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent on May 28.

The drones also successfully struck the Kronstadt drone enterprise in the same town, the Angstrem microelectronics plant in Zelenograd in Moscow Oblast, and the Dmitrievsky Chemical Plant in Ivanovo Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported.

Ukrainian drones bypassed Russian air defenses near Raduga and hit the assembly and outfitting workshops of the plant, which were still on fire as of 3 p.m. local time, the source said.

The factory, located 130 kilometers (80 miles) from Moscow, produces Kh-101/555, Kh-69, and Kh-59MK missiles used in attacks against Ukraine. The Raduga enterprise is a part of the Tactical Missile Defense Corporation.

Earlier in the day, independent news channel Astra reported that drones attacked the Kronstadt drone facility, publishing videos shot by local residents showing a drone flying over the city. The videos also show smoke rising above the area where the enterprise is located.

The Kronstadt facility specializes in the production of Orion, Molniya, Grom, and other drones, according to the Ukrainian military.

11 more Ukrainian Children rescued from Russian-occupied territories, Yermak's advisor says

Eleven more Ukrainian children have been successfully returned from Russian-occupied territories as part of the national ""Bring Kids Back UA"" initiative, Daria Zarivna, an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky’s chief of staff and head of the project, said on May 28.

Among those rescued is a young girl whose mother and brother, both defenders of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, spent more than three years in Russian captivity.

""All this time, the mother did not know whether she would ever see her children again. During the exchange, she met her son on the bus, and today she was finally able to hug her little girl,"" Zarivna said.

Another boy was reunited with his father and brother, both Ukrainian soldiers. The father has been serving on the front lines, while the brother had also been held in Russian captivity for over three years.

Zarivna also said a teenage boy who had been orphaned was rescued from Russian forces. The child had been kidnapped from his school, held in a basement, tortured, and nearly conscripted into the Russian army days before his 18th birthday.

The operation is the latest in a series of rescue missions under Bring Kids Back UA, a national initiative launched by Zelensky to coordinate the return of children abducted during Russia's full-scale invasion.

'We'll know in two weeks' if Putin serious about ending war, Trump says

U.S. President Donald Trump said on May 28 the U.S. would soon know whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is serious about ending the war in Ukraine, warning that if Moscow is stalling, Washington would ""respond a little bit differently.""

Trump said his Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is currently negotiating with Russian side, claiming he ""is doing a phenomenal job.""

""We're going to find out very soon. It'll take about two weeks, or week and a half,” Trump told reporters during a briefing, responding to a question on whether Putin wants to end the war.

""They seem to want to do something. But until the document is signed, I can't tell you... I'm very disappointed at what happened. A couple of nights now where people were killed in the middle of what you would call a negotiation."" Trump did not clarify which document he was referring to.

Trump said he disapproved of Russia's recent missile attacks on Ukrainian cities during ongoing diplomatic efforts. ""That's no good. We're not going to allow it,"" he said.

Germany pledges 5 billion euros in new aid to Ukraine, no Taurus missiles announced

Germany has unveiled a military aid package for Ukraine worth 5 billion euros ($5.65 billion), the country's Defense Ministry said in a statement on May 28 after Chancellor Friedrich Merz and President Volodymyr Zelensky met in Berlin.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius and Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov signed the accord in Berlin's Bendlerblock, the headquarters of the German Defense Ministry. The agreement includes direct German investments in Ukraine's defense industry and a broader treaty between Kyiv and German arms manufacturers.

Under the new agreement, Germany will help fund the production of long-range weapons systems inside Ukraine — tapping into the country's existing industrial capacities and technical expertise, the statement read.

German Defense Ministry said a significant number of these systems are expected to be manufactured by the end of 2025, with the first batch ready for deployment in the coming weeks. Since these systems are already in service with the Ukrainian military, no additional training is needed for their use.

Berlin also reaffirmed its commitment to supply Ukraine with critical ammunition and weapons. The arms heading Kyiv's way include air defense systems, artillery, systems of land weapons and handguns. No Taurus missiles were publicly announced as part of the package.

The meeting between Merz and Zelensky in Berlin was preceded by speculation that Germany would finally reverse its long-held policy of not sending Taurus missiles to Kyiv over fears of escalating the war against Russia.

Lavrov added that the Russian delegation, led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, is prepared to present this memorandum to the Ukrainian side and provide necessary clarifications during the second round of negotiations in Istanbul on Monday, June 2.

According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov also held a phone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, during which he informed Rubio about Moscow's preparations for concrete proposals for the upcoming round of talks with Ukraine in Istanbul.

The Foreign Ministry stated that Rubio, in turn, emphasized U.S. President Donald Trump's intention to bring the war in Ukraine to a conclusion.

Ukrainian officials have not publicly commented on the proposed meeting.

Earlier on May 28, Medinsky claimed he personally called Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to suggest holding a meeting ""in the coming days"" to exchange draft memoranda outlining conditions for a potential ceasefire.

During the first round of talks in Istanbul the two sides failed to reach agreement on a 30-day ceasefire. Ukraine had offered an immediate halt to hostilities, an all-for-all prisoner swap, and a meeting between Presidents Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin. Russia refused, instead sending a low-level delegation.

Turkey and Belgium are set to join the international Drone Coalition supporting Ukraine, Latvia's Defense Minister Andris Spruds announced on May 28 during the Drone Summit in Riga.

The coalition, co-led by Latvia and the United Kingdom, is expected to allocate 2.75 billion euros ($3.1 billion) in 2025 to support Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression.

""The international Drone Coalition is becoming increasingly stronger — we will be able to deliver more drones to Ukraine while simultaneously strengthening the defense industries of Latvia, the EU, and NATO countries,"" Spruds said. ""Our strength lies in unity.""

With the addition of Belgium and Turkey, the Drone Coalition will grow to 20 member states. The coalition, officially launched in February 2024, includes countries such as the U.K., Germany, Canada, France, Poland, Sweden, and Ukraine, among others. Each new member must be approved by existing coalition states, according to the memorandum of understanding.

Since its inception, the coalition has committed a total of 4.5 billion euros ($5 billion) in aid to Ukraine over two years, including 1.8 billion euros ($2 billion) in 2024 and the planned 2.75 billion euros ($3.1 billion) for 2025.

The Drone Coalition plays crucial role in supporting Ukraine's use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which have become key in targeting Russian military infrastructure, including airfields, oil depots, and logistics hubs deep inside Russian territory.

In March, the coalition allocated 20 million euros ($22.5 million) from a joint fund to procure tactical reconnaissance drones for Ukraine, following an urgent request from Kyiv.

The operation is the latest in a series of rescue missions under Bring Kids Back UA, a national initiative launched by Zelensky to coordinate the return of children abducted during Russia's full-scale invasion.

On May 22, Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak announced the return of nine other children from occupied areas. He described the children as survivors of grave abuse, including a girl whose life was endangered due to lack of medical care, and a boy who was imprisoned in a basement with his mother while Russian forces tortured his father nearby.

Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has identified over 19,500 children who were forcibly deported to Russia, Belarus, or Russian-occupied territories. To date, only around 1,300 have been returned to Ukrainian-controlled areas, according to official data.

The abduction of Ukrainian children has drawn international condemnation. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Children’s Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, accusing them of overseeing the forced deportations.

Earlier this month, the European Parliament passed a resolution labeling Russia's actions a ""genocidal strategy"" aimed at erasing Ukrainian identity, and demanded the unconditional return of all abducted minors.

On May 21, U.S. senators have introduced a resolution urging that no peace deal with Russia be made until all abducted Ukrainian children are returned. The resolution condemns Russia's forced deportation and Russification of Ukrainian minors as an attempt to erase Ukrainian identity.

Russian air defenses shot down 296 Ukrainian drones across multiple regions overnight, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed, potentially marking one of the heaviest drone attacks against Russia during the full-scale war.

Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin claimed that Russian air defense shot down over 30 Ukrainian drones headed toward Moscow. A total of 33 Ukrainian drones have been shot down so far, according to Russian officials.

Russian officials also announced that operations were suspended at Vnukovo, Zhukovsky, and Sheremetyevo airports.

A fire broke out in Zelenograd near Moscow, allegedly connected to the drone strikes. Russian officials have claimed that there are no casualties or serious damage to report.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

The latest drone attacks on Moscow follow a three-day wave of aerial attacks from May 24 to May 26, in which Russia fired more than 600 drones and dozens of missiles across Ukraine.

On May 26, Russian forces launched the most extensive drone attack of the full-scale war, reportedly involving 355 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys.

As Russia continues to reject calls for a ceasefire and the war drags on, Ukraine has intensified drone attacks on Russian territory. In particular, drone attacks in Russia have forced airport closures for several nights in a row.

The European Union unveiled a new security strategy for the Black Sea region on May 28, aiming to counter growing Russian threats, improve regional defense infrastructure, and deepen cooperation with key partners from Ukraine to Turkey, EU High Representative Kaja Kallas said.

Speaking at a press briefing in Brussels, Kallas outlined the bloc's ""Strategic Approach to the Black Sea Region,"" calling it essential for European security, trade, and energy resilience.

""The Black Sea region is of great strategic importance to the European Union,"" Kallas said. ""But the region's potential is marred by Russia's war. Reoccurring airspace violations, and attacks on ports and shipping lanes highlight this reality.""

Kallas proposed creating a Black Sea Maritime Security Hub, envisioned as an early warning and monitoring system that would enhance situational awareness and protect key infrastructure such as offshore energy platforms and subsea cables.

Kallas said the hub could also support future peace monitoring efforts in the event of a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. While the EU has not disclosed where the hub would be located or which countries would take part, a document seen by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty describes its focus on real-time monitoring from space to seabed, mine clearance, and the protection of commercial sea routes.

The strategy also calls for major upgrades to regional transport networks, including ports, roads, railways, and airports, to allow faster movement of heavy military equipment.

""These updates will help to ensure troops can be where they are needed, when they are needed,"" Kallas said, adding that the changes will also reinforce NATO deterrence. The EU plans to tighten screening of foreign ownership in strategic facilities, particularly in the region's ports.

The third major priority of the plan targets hybrid threats, including cyberattacks and disinformation. ""The Black Sea region is a prime target for hybrid actions,"" Kallas said. She announced that the EU would invest in artificial intelligence to counter disinformation, promote media literacy, and support fact-checking networks.

The strategy was presented amid growing concern over Russia's destabilizing activities in the Black Sea and a broader effort to strengthen EU partnerships with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Turkey, and Ukraine.

The plan notes that Turkey is a ""vital partner and candidate country"" and highlights its potential role in countering Russia's shadow fleet and ensuring maritime security.

According to RFE/RL sources, Turkey suggested it would assure safe passage in the Black Sea and potentially clear up mines in case of a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia.

Turkey has emerged as a potential mediator in Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, balancing relations with both sides through ongoing diplomatic and economic engagement. So far, Ankara has supported peace talks, helped enable grain shipments, and signaled readiness to assist in monitoring any future ceasefire.

Russia has proposed a specific date and venue for the next round of talks with Ukraine, Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, who leads Moscow's delegation in ongoing negotiations, said on May 28.

Medinsky claimed he personally called Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to suggest holding a meeting ""in the coming days"" to exchange draft memoranda outlining conditions for a potential ceasefire. He emphasized that Russia is prepared to begin substantive negotiations on each point of a future comprehensive agreement at that meeting.

""The Ukrainian side went to consult, and it seems those consultations are taking some time,"" Medinsky wrote on Telegram. ""We are ready to meet in person on the date we have set — in the next few days — to start work.""

Ukrainian officials have not publicly commented on the call.

The announcement follows a May 16 meeting between Ukrainian and Russian delegations in Istanbul, where the two sides failed to reach agreement on a 30-day ceasefire, as Russia continued pushing its maximalist demands.

Ukraine had offered an immediate halt to hostilities, an all-for-all prisoner swap, and a summit between Presidents Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin. Russia insisted Kyiv withdraw from four partially occupied Ukrainian regions it claims to have annexed.

Despite the deadlock, both sides agreed on a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange.

Earlier, Reuters reported that Moscow's demands for a ceasefire also include a written pledge that NATO will not expand further eastward, effectively blocking Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova from joining, as well as the lifting of some Western sanctions, resolution of frozen Russian assets, and what it calls the protection of Russian-speaking Ukrainians.

Despite calls for the continuation of peace talks, Russia has intensified its attacks on civilians. Russian forces launched a three-day wave of aerial attacks from May 24 to May 26, firing more than 600 drones and dozens of missiles across Ukraine.

Latest: Germany pledges 5 billion euros in new aid to Ukraine, no Taurus missiles announced

A statement from German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on May 26 about long-range strikes inside Russia resurrected a long-held hope in Ukraine — that Berlin is finally about to send Kyiv its Taurus missiles.

""There are no longer any restrictions on the range of weapons delivered to Ukraine — neither by the U.K., France, nor us. There are no restrictions by the U.S. either,"" Merz said.

Dampening expectations somewhat, Merz the next day clarified he was referring to permissions given by Ukraine's allies last year, but his mention of ""us"" still raised speculation that they could be on their way — currently, Berlin provides Ukraine with no long-range missiles that the granted permissions related to.

""It's good news that they have lifted these restrictions on the use of missiles,"" Oleksandr Merezhko, a Ukrainian lawmaker and chair of the parliament’s foreign affairs committee, told the Kyiv Independent.

""But where are these missiles? Where is Taurus, for example?"" he added.

Why hasn't Germany sent Taurus to Ukraine?

Germany’s stance on not sending Ukraine Taurus missiles was a policy largely driven by Olaf Scholz, Merz’s predecessor. Ukraine has been using U.S.-made ATACMS for over a year, and U.K.-French Storm Shadows for more than two.

""Delivering Taurus at this point is less for the Ukrainians and more for the Germans because Taurus has become this ultimate symbol of German fear and escalation angst,"" Fabian Hoffmann, a doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo specializing in missile technology, told the Kyiv Independent.

""And that's why delivering Taurus is so important — you right that wrong,"" he added.

While Scholz repeatedly blocked the delivery of Taurus missiles over his concerns about escalation, his successor has been much more open about the possibility.

In April, Merz even specifically suggested Taurus could be used to target strategic Russian military infrastructure in occupied Crimea, including the Crimean Bridge.

In an interview with ARD, Merz emphasized the need to support Ukraine in moving from a reactive to a proactive stance on the battlefield, saying Kyiv must be equipped to ""shape events"" and ""get ahead of the situation.""

""If things continue as they are, if, for example, the most important land connection between Russia and Crimea is destroyed, or if something happens on Crimea itself, where most of the Russian military logistics are located, then that would be an opportunity to bring this country strategically back into the picture, finally,"" Merz said.

The Taurus difference

In range, speed and payload, Taurus much resembles the Storm Shadow, which is made by Taurus’ manufacturer MBDA’s French affiliate.

""Scalp/Storm Shadow and Taurus belong to the same class of cruise missiles,"" a representative for MBDA Deutschland, wrote in a statement to the Kyiv Independent.

""They differ in their performance data, but are both fundamentally suitable for deep strike missions against strategic targets.""





""Taurus is the best weapon system in Western arsenals to take down bridges.""

The primary distinction for Taurus is in the design of the actual warhead — Taurus can be programmed to explode after hitting a specific target, such as a bunker.

The missile can penetrate and actually count layers before the final explosion, maximizing damage.

Taurus would represent a major upgrade to Ukraine’s deep-strike firepower, primarily because it can blast through denser Russian fortifications.

Thanks to a more efficient engine, Hoffmann explains, Taurus can also reach deeper into Russia than other system currently in Ukraine's arsenal, and packs more of an explosive punch than Ukraine’s new crop of deep-strike ""missile-drones.""

Despite a publicly advertised range of 560 or more kilometers, Hoffmann believes they can reach 700 to 800 kilometers. They are, however, air-launched, so they originate from planes that would not be over the front line, where they would be vulnerable to Russian anti-aircraft fire.

Taurus ""can be easily adapted"" to F-16 fighter jets, which are now deployed in Ukraine, and to Gripen — a Swedish aircraft that could be on their way soon.

""Taurus is the best weapon system in Western arsenals to take down bridges,"" said Hoffmann.

""So in theory, if Ukraine wants to take down the Crimean Bridge, Taurus would be the ideal weapon system to do that.""

The target — Putin's Crimean Bridge

Constructed after Russia’s illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014, the Crimean Bridge is a critical supply and transport route for Russian forces to occupied Ukrainian territories.

It also holds huge symbolic value — the $4 billion project was a political statement designed to cement what Russian President Vladimir Putin saw as one of his crowning moments — the annexation of Crimea.

The bridge has been a repeated target of Ukrainian strikes, suffering significant damage in October 2022 and July 2023, though neither managed to take the bridge out of commission.

Taurus could potentially change that.

The delay

There has so far been no confirmation of actual delivery of Taurus to Ukraine.

""We are not issuing comments on any speculation on political debates and decisions,"" a representative for MBDA Deutschland, Taurus’ manufacturer, wrote in a statement to the Kyiv Independent. ""Please rest assured that MBDA is prepared to support the German government and Ukraine with the necessary integration, training and logistics if a political decision is made.""

Hoffmann notes that Taurus today is less important for Ukraine than it would have been two years ago, when there were fewer home-grown options for deep strikes.

""If you deliver it now, Ukrainians could use it against the targets that really matter, whereas in 2023, they had to allocate Storm Shadow for everything. So there are some advantages, I'm not saying it's nothing,"" Hoffmann explained.

""But a long range drone with a 50 kg warhead or even less is perfectly fine under some circumstances. So Ukraine has a lot of options.""

Ukraine's missile stocks

Experts believe that the Taurus is unlikely to be a game-changer in the war and that while targeting the Crimean Bridge would be a big symbolic victory for Kyiv, Ukraine needs it primarily to replenish its long-range weapons stockpile.

""Storm Shadow, SCALP EG, they are running out sooner or later. Taurus is another very capable cruise missile that could be used by Ukrainians to just extend the availability of its long-range range strike capability,"" Hoffman said.

""This is a key advantage. It's mostly about the quantity and the number of missile systems available in Ukraine's arsenal.""

Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) has charged a captured Russian marine with war crimes for allegedly executing two unarmed Ukrainian prisoners of war during combat operations earlier this year in northeastern Ukraine, according to an official statement issued May 28.

According to the SBU, the soldier, a rifleman with Russia's 40th Separate Marine Brigade, participated in the point-blank shooting of two detained Ukrainian servicemen on Jan. 9 near Kursk. The executions reportedly occurred after a Russian sabotage-reconnaissance group seized a front-line position held by Ukrainian forces.

The SBU alleges the Russian fighters led the two captured soldiers into open ground before shooting them in the back with automatic rifles, killing both instantly.

Just two days later, the same Russian unit came under attack by Ukraine's Special Operations Forces. Ukrainian troops reportedly partially destroyed the unit, capturing the accused marine during a firefight. Investigators say he initially attempted to conceal his role in the killings but was later implicated through evidence collected by the SBU and military counterintelligence.

He has been formally charged under Ukraine's Criminal Code with war crimes including violations of the Geneva Convention concerning the treatment of prisoners of war. If convicted, he faces life imprisonment.

The case adds to mounting evidence of systemic war crimes committed against Ukrainian prisoners of war by Russian forces — a pattern confirmed by both Ukrainian authorities and international bodies.

At least 206 of the 5,000 Ukrainian POWs repatriated since Russia's full-scale invasion died in captivity, according to data published by Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War. In many of these cases, Ukrainian soldiers were tortured, executed, or killed under suspicious circumstances while in Russian custody.

Investigations by Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office are underway into the execution of 268 Ukrainian POWs. The U.N. and human rights groups have recorded dozens of these cases, highlighting incidents in which Russian troops received direct orders to kill surrendered soldiers — a violation of international humanitarian law.

One of the most notorious cases occurred in July 2022, when a Russian missile strike on the Olenivka POW camp in occupied Donetsk Oblast killed over 50 Ukrainian soldiers, most of them members of the Azov Regiment. Independent investigations later suggested Russia deliberately targeted the building with a thermobaric weapon after relocating the prisoners to a specific section of the facility.

In a March 2025 report, the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine confirmed growing numbers of executions of Ukrainian POWs by Russian forces, labeling the killings part of a deliberate and coordinated campaign.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1576124699.jpg

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina — When a court convicted Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik of defying an international peace envoy in February, it was supposed to end his career in politics.

He faced not only jail time, but a ban on holding public office.

But three months later, little has changed.

Dodik remains at the helm of Republika Srpska, one of two autonomous entities that make up the nation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Despite an international warrant for his arrest, Dodik has repeatedly visited one of his biggest backers, Russian President Vladimir Putin, in Moscow, using those visits to fan the flames of ethnic separatism at home.

Dodik’s embrace of the Russian strongman emphasizes the Kremlin’s outsized role in destabilizing Bosnia and Herzegovina.

But it also reflects a local struggle: After years of growing tensions, Dodik is now in open confrontation with the central government and using Russia to bolster his position.

Experts say that risks dragging the country into the greatest crisis since it was torn apart by civil war and genocide in 1992-1995.

“The situation is tense and unpredictable,” said Nebojsa Vukanovic, a member of the political opposition in Republika Srpska.

Dodik’s office did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.

Moscow’s man in the Balkans

This year alone, Dodik has already made two visits to Russia.

He first turned up in Moscow in March. Then, he returned on May 9, as Russia marked Victory Day.

In an interview with the Russian state-owned news agency TASS, he described Putin as a “person who understands perfectly well where the world is” and praised the invasion of Ukraine.

Though the trips were international, experts believe the motivation is domestic.

With roughly 1.2 million people, Republika Srpska comprises a third of the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The vast majority of the region’s residents are ethnic Serbs.

Dodik was first elected the region’s prime minister in 1998. Since then, he has come to dominate its politics.

During that time, he has often relied on threats of secession to garner support among the region’s ethnic Serb majority, according to Aleksandar Savanovic, a political sciences professor at the University of Banja Luka, the regional capital.

Until 2022, such threats were “a good way to win elections without real plans to create Republika Srpska as an independent state,” he said.

Then, around the time when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Dodik saw an opening to solidify Moscow’s support for his regime.

""Bosnians very well understand what’s happening in Ukraine because we went through the same thing in the 1990s.""

Savanovic suggests the Bosnian Serb leader believed the Kremlin would look favorably on a more brazen secessionist policy. “It was a good moment to protect his power,” he said.

Since then, Dodik has held multiple meetings with Putin and has become one of the Russian invasion’s most vocal supporters in Europe. Much to the chagrin of Western leaders, his comments regularly echo false Kremlin talking points – including the “extermination of the Russian population in Ukraine” and Ukraine’s “bombings” in the country’s eastern regions.

Ismet Fatih Cancar, a former advisor to the minister of security of Bosnia and Herzegovina and an expert on international security in the Balkans, emphasizes that similar ethnic allegations of repressions against Bosnia’s Serb population underpin Dodik’s secessionist aims.

Those claims date back to the 1990s, when Serb nationalists’ attempt to preserve an ethnically homogenous state fueled a civil war and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

But Cancar believes they are “completely out of reality.”

“I think Bosnians very well understand what’s happening in Ukraine because we went through the same thing in the 1990s,” he said.

Dodik isn’t the only one who stands to gain from efforts to destabilize Bosnia and Herzegovina. Cancar thinks Russia would also benefit “from having another conflict that will divert attention from Ukraine.”

Showdown in court

Although separatist rhetoric is not new in Republika Srpska, the tipping point came in 2023, when Dodik supported the passage of a controversial measure to suspend the rulings of Bosnia’s Constitutional Court inside Republika Srpska.

That threatened to undermine the foundations of peace in the country.

Under the Dayton Accords, which ended the civil war in 1995, a high representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina is tasked with overseeing the civilian implementation of the agreement. Since 2021, German politician Christian Schmidt has held that position.

Controversially, the high representative has the power to impose and annul laws.

On July 1, 2023, Schmidt did just that: He annulled the Republika Srpska judicial measure against the Constitutional Court and amended the criminal code to make defying the “constitutional order” a crime.

Dodik signed the measure Schmidt annulled into law anyway. Prosecutors filed an indictment against him the following month.

In February, following a lengthy trial, a court in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, found Dodik guilty of defying the high representative’s orders, sentencing him to one year in jail and banning him from office for six years.

On April 23, state police attempted to arrest Dodik, but were repelled by Republika Srpska police.

“This is a serious political and constitutional crisis,” the Office of the High Representative said in a statement to the Kyiv Independent. It considers the law and Dodik’s actions a “de facto coup d’etat” that threatens constitutional order and Bosnia and Herzegovina’s bid for EU membership.

Walking the streets of Banja Luka, it’s not difficult to understand the danger.

The city is filled with advertisements for Dodik’s political party, the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats. Billboards bear his image and push his narrative. One reads: “They tried me because they couldn’t put a million Serbs in the courtroom!”

Their effect is less clear.

""Putin is, in this logic of Serbian peoples, the biggest politician in the world.""

According to Savanovic, Dodik’s defiance of the country’s peace mechanisms has actually alienated his supporters, many of whom do not want a return to the conflict of the 1990s.

“I don’t know a single person in Banja Luka who supports Mr. Dodik, even in his political party,” he said.

“He expected more support from the people,” said Tanja Topic, a journalist and the head of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation in the city.

Internationally, the picture is hardly rosy. Even President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia, usually a reliable ally, is currently distracted by his own domestic political crisis, Topic added. And Dodik’s gamble that U.S. President Donald Trump would adopt a more accommodating stance on his nationalistic policies has not paid off.

She believes that Dodik’s visits to Russia were an attempt to shore up support among his remaining allies and supporters.

“He used these opportunities to create a pro-Russia narrative in Republika Srpska,” Topic said. “Putin is, in this logic of Serbian peoples, the biggest politician in the world.”

Signs of support for Russia are common in Banja Luka. A stand selling T-shirts to tourists features one with Putin’s face alongside those displaying Serb nationalistic slogans. There is a Putin-themed restaurant in town, and Russia opened a branch of its embassy here in the summer of 2024.

In 2018, local officials announced that they would begin construction of a Russian cultural center.

On a recent visit to the planned site, construction was in full swing. At its center is an Orthodox Church covered in a web of scaffolding. The metal skeletons of two onion domes lay in the dust nearby. Officials recently said that the complex will be complete this summer.

Dangerous territory

Russia’s influence in the region may not be merely diplomatic and financial.

Last fall, reports that Moldova had uncovered a pro-Kremlin hybrid warfare operation shined a spotlight on Republika Srpska. Moldovan authorities said that Russia used camps in the region to train agitators to provoke instability in Moldova around its October presidential election.

Officials in Republika Srpska have denied the existence of such camps. Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Defense Ministry did not respond to requests for comment or interviews with officials.

But the scandal emphasized the high stakes of Russian influence in Republika Srpska.

Now, no one is sure how the current crisis may play out.

While few believe there will be a return to violence, experts told the Kyiv Independent that tensions can continue to escalate and small-scale conflict is possible.

Dodik, meanwhile, shows no sign of backing down. In March, he announced that Republika Srpska would form an independent border police force, a potential major escalation.

“If we accept this as a status quo, (Dodik) will take this as a form of support or silent acquiescence to what he’s done and will move on the offensive,” said Cancar, the international security expert.

That could mean the Republika Srpska’s slow integration into Serbia and restrictions on the movement of people, goods, and services along Bosnia and Herzegovina’s internal boundaries.

“And then at that point,” Cancar added, “all bets are off.”",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2147907765.jpg

With no end to the invasion of Ukraine in sight, U.S. President Donald Trump may follow the EU after all and impose more sanctions on Russia, already the world’s most sanctioned country, days after saying he wouldn’t.



Ukraine’s allies have imposed sanctions on Russia, as well as thousands of individuals and entities both in the country and around the world for aiding Moscow’s full-scale invasion. But there is still room for more sanctions to be introduced, experts told the Kyiv Independent.



While Russia’s economy hasn’t crashed and burned as some expected, the three years of sanctions are eroding the country’s fiscal stability, despite Moscow claiming otherwise. Russian GDP growth has dropped precipitously this year as sanctions hamper its main sources of income — oil and gas revenue — and curb imports of components needed for its military-industrial complex.



Sanctions on their own won’t end the war, but they are a crucial tool in the West’s efforts to pressure Putin to the negotiation table. Washington’s seesawing on its sanctions strategy has alarmed Brussels, but Europe and others remain united on the effort.



“All the other partners that we've been talking to, including Switzerland, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea, all think that Russia should be stopped with the help of the sanctions, and they're ready to do it,” Ukraine’s sanctions chief Vladyslav Vlasiuk told the Kyiv Independent.

“The EU has a lot of leverage in not just maintaining the sanctions pressure, but even increasing sanctions pressure,” he said.

Trump initially rejected joining the EU in further sanctioning Moscow for fear of derailing future trade and business opportunities with Russia, the New York Times reported on May 20. The previous week, Brussels said it was gearing up for a massive sanctions package after Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to attend peace talks in Istanbul on May 15.



Russia’s colossal three-day drone and missile campaign on May 23-26 appeared to change Trump’s mind. Speaking to reporters on May 25, he said he was considering sanctions after Putin had “gone absolutely crazy.”

Have sanctions against Russia worked?

Western sanctions have impeded Russia’s energy, financial, and military sectors, even if they haven’t stopped the war. Russia still has loopholes to get around sanctions, such as importing prohibited goods through Central Asia, but they are generally costly and time-consuming.



Ukraine and its allies have three key objectives when it comes to sanctions, according to Vlasiuk. To deny Russian state revenues, reduce its military capabilities, and undermine Putin’s regime.



The first two have yielded substantial results, with Russia losing $150 billion in oil revenues in three years due to energy sanctions and its military sector facing shortages in critical components, said Vlasiuk. The third hasn’t been successful as Putin still has widespread support from the Russian public, and that doesn’t look set to change, Vlasiuk added.



This year, Russia’s economy has started to contract for the first time since the start of the full-scale invasion in the first quarter of the year, shrinking by 0.4% compared to the previous quarter. In the same period, Russia’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth saw a precipitous drop from 4.5% to just 1.4%.



While it’s hard to paint a fully accurate picture of Russia’s economy, due to the Kremlin restricting and manipulating data, Sussex University economics professor Richard Disney estimates that Russia’s economy is around 10% below what it would have been if it hadn’t invaded Ukraine.



""There's a shortage of workforce, there's the depletion of bank reserves, there's the collapse of certain investments. Foreign investment has dried up in Russia,"" Disney told the Kyiv Independent.

“The West is not willing to impose the sort of sanctions on Russia that would indeed be 'massive' because those sanctions would inevitably have a blowback on European economies and this would be weaponized by nationalist politicians.”

“Russia has gone from being close to a first-world country to heading in the direction of the third world,” he added.



Moscow has batted away claims that sanctions are impacting Russia, pointing to its economic growth over the last three years. In reality, it has divested spending from things like education and infrastructure towards the military.



This distorts actual GDP figures, and consumer spending and public investments have likely dropped by 15-20% compared to pre-war estimates, leaving Russians much poorer in reality, said Disney.



Western policymakers, particularly in Europe, have fed into Moscow’s propaganda by bigging up the impact of sanctions while holding back full force, said Tom Keatinge, director of the Center for Finance and Security at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a think tank. Instead, policymakers need to “manage expectations” on sanctions, he said.



The sanctions have also been imposed gradually over the three years instead of all at once, due to political hesitations and concerns about disruptions to global markets. While this gives governments time to fully prepare for the consequences of the sanctions, it means they are less effective.



“The West is not willing to impose the sort of sanctions on Russia that would indeed be 'massive' because those sanctions would inevitably have a blowback on European economies and this would be weaponized by nationalist politicians,” Keatinge said.



“The result is that Russia can adapt, shape-shift, and continue to gather the income and resources it needs to conduct its illegal war in Ukraine.”

Which sanctions have been effective?

Sanctions on Russia’s energy sector have often been criticized for being too loose, as Moscow exploits loopholes to export oil and gas and skirt the $60 oil price cap set by the West. Still, Russia’s fossil fuel sector continues to hemorrhage profits, and Europe has largely banned Russian energy, although it continues to import Russian liquid natural gas (LNG).



Russia earned around 242 billion euros ($275 billion) from fossil fuels last year, a 3% drop from 2023, according to the Helsinki-based Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). Sweeping sanctions at the start of the year helped tie up loose ends and targeted Russia’s opaque and uninsured shadow fleet, which carried 61% of its seaborne oil exports in 2024.



Once a vessel is sanctioned, ports will refuse to allow it to dock. In turn, Russia must spend more money finding new vessels to expand the fleet, piling up the costs and running down the profits.



""Selling oil through tankers is a lot more expensive than selling it through a pipeline,” said Disney.



Alongside energy sanctions, the West also went after Russia’s financial institutions at the start of the full-scale invasion. Most Russian banks, including its Central Bank, are barred from the Western financial world and cannot be used for trade or capital operations.



In 2022, Europe kicked major Russian banks off the SWIFT interbanking system, which pushed Moscow towards the Chinese banking system. But Chinese banks began limiting Russian transactions from December 2023 after Washington threatened to cut dollar access to institutions supporting Russia's military suppliers.

In November 2024, Washington imposed even more sanctions on 50 Russian banks, making transactions between China and Russia even more arduous. Moscow has repeatedly tried to lift financial sanctions and restore access to SWIFT, like in March, when it demanded a ceasefire in the Black Sea in return, which ultimately failed to materialize.



The West also froze some $300 billion in Russian Central Bank (CBR) assets at the start of the invasion, equating to around half of its foreign currency reserves. While there has been a hot debate about whether to mobilize these assets for Ukraine, simply taking so much money out of Russia’s reach was one of the most impactful sanctions, said Keatinge.



“Of course, this has been undermined by the Kremlin's ability to continue to raise foreign income via the sale of oil, so the effectiveness of the CBR asset freeze is reduced every day a Russian tanker is able to deliver oil,” he added.



In terms of tangible impact on the battlefield, Vlasiuk points towards the coalition of countries that prevents critical weapons components from entering Russia, known as the Common High Priority (CHP) item list. It covers everything from microelectronics to CNC machines and extends beyond Western nations to include countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan.



“It imposes extra export controls over certain categories of products from the CHP list. And that makes it much more difficult for Russia to get those items imported,” Vlasiuk said.



Imports of these components are still flowing into Russia via third countries, largely in Asia. It is just harder to get them and more costly, leaving the Russian arms sector scrambling to find alternatives.

What’s next?

Amid Washington’s oscillating policy, EU sanctions chief David O'Sullivan warned of disunity on the sanctions front, German media Suddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) reported on May 27. Although even if the U.S. doesn’t end up imposing new sanctions, its current ones should remain in place, Vlasiuk said.



Fortunately for Ukraine, the EU is much more definitive on its sanctions policy. Brussels believes they are working and threatened “massive” sanctions if Russia rejects ceasefire proposals, which Moscow has so far.



“We are continuing to work on a new package of sanctions, precisely because that seems to be the only language that is understood by President Putin,” European Commission Chief Spokesperson Paula Pinho told the Kyiv Independent.



The 18th package will be ready “as soon as possible,” Anita Hipper, European Commission Foreign Affairs Spokesperson, said at a press briefing on May 22. It could take time, however, to get signed off by the EU’s problem child, Hungary, which has slowed down previous sanction efforts.



Details on the package have not yet been announced. But Hipper said the now destroyed Nord Stream pipelines connecting Europe and Russia would be included, likely to prevent their resurrection, as well as shadow fleet vessels, and crude oil.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on May 16 that Russia’s banking sector would also be included, with potentially 20 more banks disconnected from SWIFT. The EU may also propose lowering the oil price cap from $60 to $45 to further hit Russia’s energy sector.



Some are sceptical that the EU will actually deliver the blow that is really needed. “The problem is that Europe has continuously overpromised and under-delivered,” said Keatinge.



If Brussels is serious, then sanctions really need to tighten up the loopholes, said Vlasiuk. This means not just lowering the oil price cap but also sanctioning shadow fleet captains, prohibiting all maritime services for Russian oil exports, and a total ban on Russian LNG imports to Europe, which hit record levels last year, he said.



Europe should also continue to disconnect the remaining Russian banks from SWIFT, Vlasiuk said. Russia uses cryptocurrencies and third countries' financial systems to circumvent sanctions, and these should be cracked down on too, he added.



There are also raw material imports that Europe could go after to stop them from getting to Russia’s military sector. Ukraine has identified materials such as titanium, antimony, beryllium, lithium, and carbon fiber as potential targets.



“The Russian military defense sector is also very dependent not just on the microelectronics and cutting-edge technologies but also on selected raw materials and critical minerals,” Vlasiuk said.



“Sanctions work and we just need more,” he added.

The German government will ""do everything to ensure that Nord Stream 2 cannot be put back into operation,"" German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on May 28.

Speaking during a joint press conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Berlin, Merz vowed to ""further increase the pressure on Russia"" as Moscow intensifies its attacks on Ukrainian cities.

Kyiv's European partners have pledged to ramp up economic pressure on Russia as it continues to reject a ceasefire. Though no step has been taken so far, Zelensky hinted on May 27 that the EU's upcoming 18th package could have a significant impact on the Russian economy.

According to earlier reporting, the upcoming package could include a complete ban on restarting Nord Stream pipelines and new banking sanctions.

The goal of the sanctions must be to ""weaken Moscow's war machine,"" Merz added.

Nord Stream 1 and 2 are gas pipelines running between Russia and Germany under the Baltic Sea. Nord Stream 2 has never been activated, and the pipes shut down after suspected sabotage in 2022.

President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed on May 27 that he will attend the Group of Seven (G7) summit scheduled to take place in Canada in June, Suspilne reported.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney invited Zelensky in March to attend the summit, shortly after he took office.

Zelensky confirmed that he had received an invitation from Carney, but did not specify whether he would attend the event in person or online.

The president added that NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte was also willing to include Ukraine at the alliance summit on June 24-25.

""It is very important for Ukraine to understand in what format it can be presented. There are many different signals regarding NATO (summit),"" Zelensky said.

Canada, which holds the G7 presidency this year, will host the summit on June 15-17 in Kananaskis County, located in the western province of Alberta.

This summit will be the first for new Canadian Prime Minister Carney and U.S. President Donald Trump after his return to the White House.

Germany and Ukraine will sign a memorandum on the joint purchase of ""long-range fires"" made by Ukrainian producers, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced on May 28.

Berlin will also help finance the operations of Starlink in Ukraine, a U.S. satellite communications system crucial for the Ukrainian military, Merz added.

""There will be no restrictions on long-range weapons, Ukraine will be able to fully defend itself and also strike military targets outside the territory of Ukraine,"" Merz said alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky during a joint press conference in Berlin.

""This is the beginning of a new form of military-industrial cooperation between our countries, which has significant potential."" He added that the production itself can take place either in Ukraine or Germany.

The meeting between Merz and Zelensky was preceded by speculation that Germany would finally reverse its long-held policy of not sending Taurus missiles to Kyiv over fears of escalating the war against Russia.

Speaking at the conference, Merz evaded answering a direct question about potential Taurus deliveries and refused to discuss military support for Ukraine in detail.

""We will continue our military support and expand it,"" Merz said.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the chancellor's statements a ""provocation"" and suggested it may hinder peace efforts.

Moscow has repeatedly rejected calls by Kyiv and its Western partners for a ceasefire and only intensified attacks on Ukrainian cities.

Before becoming chancellor, Merz, elected for the CDU/CSU conservative alliance, signaled he would overturn a ban on Taurus deliveries imposed by his predecessor, Social Democrat Olaf Scholz.

Ukraine has been using U.S.-made ATACMS for over a year, and U.K.-French Storm Shadows for more than two.

Only in late 2024, the Biden administration and other allies eased the restrictions, allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles against Russian military targets on Russian territory.

Western sanctions will significantly affect the Russian economy in the early summer of 2026, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on May 27 during a press briefing, Suspilne reported.

Ukraine's partners have imposed heavy sanctions on Russia since the beginning of the invasion in 2022. In spite of these measures, Moscow retains its ability to wage war, gradually advancing in several sectors of the front line and increasing its defense production.

Zelensky said he hopes that in June 2026, there will be no more war in Ukraine, but Russia will still feel the pressure of sanctions.

""Sometime in the summer of 2026, their economy will feel it strongly,"" Zelensky said.

The president added that the biggest challenge at the moment is the developing Russian military-industrial complex. At the same time, he noted that Russia will not be able to increase its defense potential next year, citing Ukrainian estimates.

""We see that it (the Russian military-industrial complex) will not be able to grow next year, its growth will decrease. And it will decrease constantly. That is, the economy will completely change, they will spend everything on war,"" Zelensky said.

Zelensky stressed the significance of the West, particularly the U.S., increasing sanctions pressure on Russia.

""We are waiting for sanctions from the U.S. Europe has done it, and there is the 17th package. We have been discussing the details of the 18th package, so that it will be stronger,"" Zelensky said, adding that if the next package is supported, the consequences for Russia could be significant.

Zelensky's statement comes as U.S. President Donald Trump is considering imposing sanctions on Russia this week, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on May 26. The sanctions would reportedly aim to push Russia to the negotiating table but may not include additional banking restrictions, according to the media outlet.

Trump's stance on U.S. sanctions against Russia has been unclear. Trump has repeatedly threatened additional economic measures against Moscow but said he does not plan to take the step at the moment after his phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

A bipartisan group of U.S. Senators has said they are ready to vote on a bill on sanctions against Russia if peace talks over the war in Ukraine do not progress soon. The bill, introduced to the Senate in early April, would impose new penalties on Russia and slap 500% tariffs on imports from countries that buy Russian oil, petroleum products, natural gas, or uranium.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169777527.jpg

Lithuania has demanded more than 200 million euros ($227 million) in compensation for the migration crisis caused by Belarus, Lithuanian broadcaster LRT reported on May 26.

The demand comes after Lithuania instituted legal proceedings against Belarus in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on May 19, alleging that Minsk is ""facilitating, supporting, and enabling the smuggling of migrants"" into Lithuania.

""The initial estimates of damages, estimated to be more than 200 million euros, are allocated only to resolve the crisis within the internal affairs system. The calculations will be revised,"" the Lithuanian Ministry of Justice said in a comment to Baltic News Service.

Since 2021, Vilnius has accused Minsk of orchestrating a surge in irregular migrant crossings into Lithuania in an effort to destabilize Ukraine's EU and NATO ally.

In its lawsuit, Lithuania claims that the damages incurred between 2021 and 2023 resulted from building a physical barrier, enhancing border surveillance systems, and deploying an unprecedented number of personnel to the border due to Belarus' actions.

According to the Ministry of Justice, if the court recognizes a direct link between Belarus's actions and the resulting damages in Lithuania, it could set a precedent, making it easier to establish responsibility in future cases.

Poland may also join the lawsuit, independent Belarusian outlet Euroradio reported on May 23. Poland’s Foreign Ministry confirmed it was aware of Lithuania’s initiative and shares the view that Belarus has violated international law.

Belarus, which has not yet responded to the proceedings initiated by Lithuania, is one of Russia's staunchest allies, and part of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine was launched from its territory.

Despite raising the issue with Belarusian authorities, Vilnius says that Minsk has refused to cooperate to limit illegal migration.

Lithuania previously said in April 2023 that it has refused entry to 20,000 migrants from Belarus, although that number has significantly grown since. Vilnius previously demanded Minsk pay 120 million euros ($134 million) from Belarus for facilitating the mass crossings.

Lithuania borders Russia's Kaliningrad exclave to the southwest and Belarus to the east and south. Tensions between NATO and Moscow have escalated since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Moscow has previously been accused of similar tactics, aimed at destabilizing NATO allies in the Baltics.

In response to Helsinki's accession into NATO, Finland has accused neighboring Russia of weaponizing migration by encouraging migrants from countries like Syria and Somalia to cross the border.

As Lithuania continues to strengthen its defenses along its borders with Belarus and Russia, the country announced on May 5 that it will invest 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) over the next decade to install anti-tank mines in order to ""block and slow"" a possible invasion.

A meeting between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""fundamentally possible,"" but must be based upon ""specific agreements"" between the two sides, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on May 28.

""Our position on the fundamental possibility of such a meeting has not changed,"" Peskov said, according to the Russian pro-state news agency Interfax.

""But such a meeting should be the result of specific agreements between the two delegations in various areas,"" he said when asked about the possibility of a meeting between Putin, Zelensky, and potentially U.S. President Donald Trump.

The comments come after Zelensky declared he is ready to meet the Russian leader in a three-way format with Trump to discuss peace efforts in Ukraine. The U.S. president has vowed to broker a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow and supported the idea of a summit at the highest level.

""We are ready to meet at the level of leaders. The American side knows this, and the Russian side knows this. We are ready for the 'Trump, Putin, and me' format, and we are ready for the Trump-Putin, Trump-Zelensky format, and then the three of us,"" Zelensky said on May 27.

Moscow continues to reject calls by Kyiv and Western partners for a ceasefire, and has only intensified strikes against Ukrainian cities while reportedly preparing a new offensive this summer.

It is not immediately clear what agreements the Kremlin requires to arrange the meeting.

Ukraine's head of state previously invited Putin for face-to-face talks in Istanbul on May 16. Putin refused to attend himself, instead dispatching a delegation of junior aides led by Vladimir Medinsky.

The peace talks have not yielded any breakthrough apart from a major prisoner exchange.

The Kremlin has also repeatedly attacked Zelensky's legitimacy as president, pointing out that his first presidential term was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024.

Ukraine's constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia's full-scale invasion began in 2022. As a result, Zelensky's term has been extended, which constitutional lawyers argue is permitted under Ukrainian law.

Russian President Vladimir Putin demands a written pledge by NATO not to accept more Eastern European members and the lifting of several sanctions as conditions for ending Russia's war in Ukraine, Reuters reported on May 28, citing three undisclosed Russian sources.

One senior Russian source told Reuters that Putin is ready for a peace agreement, but ""not at any price.""

A ban on NATO's ""eastward expansion"" would rule out the future accession of Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, and others.

Moscow has claimed that Ukraine's NATO aspirations have been one of the key causes of the Russian invasion. The Russian aggression against Ukraine began in 2014 with the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas, a time when Kyiv had little prospect of joining the alliance in the foreseeable future.

Russia wants to see Ukraine neutral, and is seeking to lift some Western sanctions, resolve the issue of frozen Russian assets, and ""protect"" Russian-speaking residents of Ukraine, Reuters' sources added.

Moscow has spread the narrative that Kyiv is oppressing Russian-language speakers in Ukraine through its legislation. The Russian language remains widely spoken across the country, though the Ukrainian government adopted a number of reforms in recent years to promote the Ukrainian language and identity in the public sphere after decades of Russification under the Russian and Soviet rule.

One of the sources said that Putin realizes he will not be able to reach a peace agreement on his terms, so he will try to show Ukraine and Europe with his military gains that ""peace tomorrow will be even more painful.""

Following the call with U.S. President Donald Trump on May 19, Putin said Russia's position in the negotiations remains unchanged and requires ""eliminating the root causes"" of the war, including an alleged threat from NATO.

Trump has repeatedly echoed Moscow's narrative that Ukraine's efforts to join NATO have been one of the root causes of the full-scale invasion. Kyiv rejected restrictions on joining international alliances and organizations — namely, NATO and the EU — as part of a potential peace deal.

Editor's note: The story was updated with recent developments.

President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Berlin on May 28 for talks with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, as Germany seeks to project continued support for Kyiv in the face of Russian aggression.

The two leaders will discuss Germany's military assistance and ceasefire efforts, a German government spokesperson said. Zelensky is also expected to meet with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

Zelensky was welcomed by Merz shortly after his arrival, with the Ukrainian delegation also including Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and other aides.

The visit comes amid renewed speculation of a potential delivery of Taurus missiles, Germany's cruise missiles capable of striking targets at a distance of 500 kilometers (300 miles).

Before becoming chancellor, Merz, elected for the CDU/CSU conservative alliance, signaled he would overturn his predecessor, Social Democrat Olaf Scholz's, ban on delivering the missiles to Ukraine.

Kyiv has called upon Germany to provide the weapons to be able to strike targets deep inside the Russian rear, while Scholz has ruled out the move due to fears of escalation.

Merz is yet to greenlight the deliveries, as a change of policy on Taurus missiles has become a point of contention between the CDU/CSU and their Social Democratic (SPD) coalition partners.

Adding to the confusion, the German chancellor declared earlier this week that Berlin and other Western partners have lifted all range restrictions on arms provided to Ukraine, which some saw as a signal of an incoming change of policy on Taurus missiles.

Merz later clarified he was referring to a step made months ago, and German Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil confirmed that the new government has made no new decision in this regard.

Earlier in May, the German government announced that it would no longer publish arms it had delivered to Ukraine, meaning that a potential supply of Taurus missiles may not be announced to the public.

Speaking to journalists in Kyiv on May 27, Zelensky said he would discuss the issue of long-range arms for Ukraine with Merz, adding he has not heard any signals about a change in policy.

Ukraine has previously received long-range missiles from the U.S., the U.K., and France — including ATACMS, Storm Shadow, and SCALP — but was initially permitted to deploy them only against Russian military forces in occupied Ukrainian territories.

Only in late 2024, the Biden administration and other allies eased the restrictions, allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles against Russian military targets on Russian territory.

Germany has been Ukraine's leading military donor on the continent, and its support is even more crucial for Kyiv now as U.S. backing grows increasingly uncertain under President Donald Trump.

Belarus will reduce the parameters of the upcoming Zapad-2025 military drills and move maneuvers further inland from the western border to reduce tensions in the region, Belarusian Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin claimed on May 28.

Zapad drills are large-scale joint military exercises regularly held by Russian and Belarusian forces. Minsk confirmed earlier this year that the 2025 drills will take place in mid-September, involving 13,000 soldiers.

""We have made a decision to reduce the parameters of the Joint Strategic Exercise 'Zapad-2025' and move its main maneuvers deep into the territory of the Republic of Belarus from the western borders,"" Khrenin said, according to the Belarusian Defense Ministry's Telegram channel.

Khrenin made the announcement during a meeting of Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) ministers in Bishkek.

The exercises have raised alarm in Kyiv and NATO, as they will take place amid Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Moscow's increasingly aggressive posture toward Western allies.

President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Russia plans to deploy 15 divisions, totaling 100,000 to 150,000 troops, primarily in Belarus, possibly in preparation for a major military escalation.

Responding to the Russian-Belarusian drills, Poland has announced it would hold simultaneous and proportional exercises involving NATO partners.

Khrenin claimed that Zapad drills are ""not aimed against anyone,"" stressing that Minsk's decision ""indicates a readiness for dialogue and a reduction in tensions in the region.""

Russia seeks to produce up to 500 drones per day, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on May 27 during a press briefing, Suspilne reported.

Moscow has significantly increased the production of various drones over the past year, which it launches almost every night to attack Ukrainian cities and front-line positions.

The Russian production surge is facilitated by imports of components from China and the recruitment of low-skilled labor, including local teenagers and workers from Africa.

""They (Russian manufacturers) are preparing to produce 300-350 drones per day. This is their real situation. They were tasked with having 500 per day,"" Zelensky said.

Zelensky expressed doubt that Russia could launch 1,000 drones in a single attack, but acknowledged it could become possible in the future if Russia amasses enough drones over time.

According to Zelensky, Ukraine is already capable of launching up to 100 long-range drones daily, and with the support of partners, it can catch up with Russia by producing 300-350 drones every day.

""We are very close to it. The issue is not production capacity. It is a financial issue,"" the president added.

Zelensky also recalled a recent successful operation by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which used 400 small drones simultaneously and destroyed 40 pieces of Russian military hardware.

""We will show them much more than this operation,"" Zelensky said. Ukraine has been rapidly developing its domestic arms industry since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022.

Ukraine more than doubled its production of long-range drones in 2024 compared to the previous year, which is a 22-fold increase compared to 2022. In total, 324 new types of weapons were developed in Ukraine by the end of 2024, according to Ukraine's Strategic Industries Ministry.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on May 27 that he does not believe the U.S. would support a full Ukrainian withdrawal from four of its partially occupied regions, a demand repeatedly raised by Russia, Interfax-Ukraine news agency reported.

""What's written in the ultimatums doesn't matter if we're talking about more than just a piece of paper; we're talking about what could lead to the first step: a ceasefire,"" Zelensky told journalists, according to the news agency.

""I think that even at the highest level, the United States today will not support Ukraine withdrawing from the territories"" controlled by Ukraine, he continued, adding that Kyiv does not want Washington to walk away from the peace efforts.

Russia again rejected Kyiv and Western partners' calls for an unconditional ceasefire during recent peace talks in Istanbul, insisting instead that Ukraine must withdraw its forces from Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts.

Moscow illegally declared the annexation of the four regions in September 2022, despite not controlling them fully. Russia continues to occupy roughly 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula illegally annexed in 2014.

As the Trump administration has sought to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, it has reportedly offered wide-ranging concessions to Moscow, including a potential recognition of its control over Crimea and the lifting of sanctions.

At the same time, U.S. officials have signaled opposition to Russia's demand for Ukraine's withdrawal from the Ukrainian-held territories. U.S. Vice President JD Vance said on May 7 that Russia is ""asking for too much,"" underscoring Washington's growing frustration with Moscow's delays.

Russia mobilizes around 40,000-45,000 men for its military every month, while Ukraine mobilizes about 25,000-27,000, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on May 27.

Moscow has only intensified its war effort despite calls by Kyiv, the U.S., and European partners for an unconditional ceasefire as a first step toward a peace deal.

""When the U.S. sends signals that it wants to do something positive with Russia, then Russia ramps up its mobilization,"" Zelensky said, according to the NV outlet.

While Ukraine estimates that Russia has suffered close to 1 million casualties during the full-scale war, it has been largely able to offset the losses by fresh contract soldiers.

In late 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree to increase the size of Russia's Armed Forces to about 2.4 million, including 1.5 million military personnel.

Russia also aims to conscript 160,000 men for compulsory military service this year, marking the largest conscription campaign in 14 years.

Russia conducts conscription twice a year, in spring and fall, requiring eligible men to serve for one year. Although Russian conscripts are typically not deployed in active combat, Moscow has relied on financial incentives and pardons to recruit civilians for the war in Ukraine.

Following the unpopular September 2022 mobilization, which saw over 261,000 Russians flee the country, Putin has avoided another large-scale draft, instead using alternative methods to bolster troop numbers.

Unlike Russia, Ukraine faced serious manpower shortages in late 2024 amid a heavy Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast. The Ukrainian leadership has sought to alleviate the crisis by broadening the mobilization pool and offering new incentives for volunteers.

Men aged between 25 and 60 can be drafted into Ukraine's Armed Forces, while those aged 18-24 may volunteer to serve, according to the latest legislation. Zelensky said earlier this year that Ukraine has around 800,000 soldiers deployed against 600,000 Russian troops.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2151581589.jpg

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on May 27 that he is ready for a trilateral meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Suspilne reported.

Putin previously said he was ready to meet with Zelensky. When the latter invited him to meet in Istanbul, the Russian president did not show up. Instead, Russian and Ukrainian delegations held lower-level peace talks on May 16.

""We are ready to meet at the level of leaders. The American side knows this, and the Russian side knows this. We are ready for the 'Trump, Putin, and me' format, and we are ready for the Trump-Putin, Trump-Zelensky format, and then the three of us,"" Zelensky said.

""If Putin is not comfortable with a bilateral meeting, or if everyone wants it to be a trilateral meeting, I don't care. I am ready for any format,"" Zelensky added.

Zelensky said that several venues are being considered for future talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the U.S., particularly Istanbul, Switzerland, and the Vatican.

""The Turkish side knows that we are discussing several sites. And that we have done preparatory work on the Vatican and Switzerland,"" the president said, adding that the idea of holding talks in the Vatican ""was supported by everyone except Russia, as can be seen in the media.""

According to Zelensky, Turkey is ""the most realistic option"" for the next round of negotiations. Meanwhile, Russia is also offering Belarus as a venue for the next meeting, which is unacceptable for Kyiv, Zelensky added.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said Moscow would welcome a second round of peace talks with Ukraine in Istanbul. The Russian top diplomat dismissed the Vatican as a possible venue, saying the Catholic seat would not be an appropriate platform for negotiations between two Orthodox Christian nations.

Lavrov said on May 28 that the next round of talks will be announced ""soon,"" and that Russia will push for the abolition of laws it calls ""discriminatory"" toward Russian-language speakers, as well as for Ukraine's non-aligned status.

Moscow has repeatedly presented a ban on Ukraine's entry to NATO as its key demand, which Kyiv rejected.

Turkey previously hosted peace negotiations in March 2022. Since then, Ankara has maintained active contact with both Kyiv and Moscow and facilitated multiple prisoner exchanges, as well as the now-defunct Black Sea Grain Initiative.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156503093.jpg

Russian forces are accumulating 50,000 troops near Ukraine's northeastern Sumy Oblast, seeking to create a 10-kilometer buffer zone in the area, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists in a press briefing on May 27.

""Now, they are accumulating troops in the direction of Sumy. Over 50,000. We understand, but have had success there,"" Zelensky said in comments reported by Ukrinform on May 28, adding that Moscow is concentrating its best troops in neighboring Kursk Oblast.

The statement comes amid warnings of a new possible Russian offensive this summer as U.S.-mediated peace efforts have failed to produce a ceasefire deal.

Russia has become increasingly active in Sumy Oblast after mostly pushing out Ukrainian forces from Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian authorities recently confirmed that Russian forces captured four Sumy Oblast villages close to the border: Novenke, Zhuravka, Veselivka, and Basivka.

According to Kyiv, Russia planned to launch an offensive into Sumy Oblast already back in 2024, but the plan was disrupted by Ukraine's incursion into Kursk Oblast. Moscow has repeatedly indicated plans to create a buffer zone between Ukraine and Russia in the area.

Zelensky added that Russian forces will also do ""everything"" to enter Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, an eastern region commonly targeted by aerial strikes but so far untouched by Russian ground operations.

""They will do everything to cross the administrative border of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast... So far, they have not succeeded,"" Zelensky said. According to the president, Russia's key strategic goal remains taking full control of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

Editor's note: The article was updated with a response from U.S. Special Envoy Keith Kellogg.

U.S. President Donald Trump is weighing new sanctions on Russia after a deadly weekend of missile and drone strikes across Ukraine, as Moscow delays delivering a promised peace proposal.

During a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 19, Trump was told that a ""memorandum of peace"" outlining conditions for a ceasefire would be delivered shortly. As of May 27, no such document has been received, a U.S. official and a White House source familiar with the matter told CNN.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said earlier that there was ""no timeline"" for completing the document, according to Russian state media TASS.

""He’s killing a lot of people,"" Trump said of Putin on May 25. ""I don’t know what’s wrong with him. What the hell happened to him?"" The president's comments came amid mounting pressure from both parties in Congress to take a firmer stance.

More than 80 senators have backed a bipartisan bill seeking sweeping new measures, including secondary sanctions and 500% tariffs on nations purchasing Russian energy. ""All of us, by our public statements as well as private contacts, are pressing very, very hard,"" Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal told CNN.

On Truth Social, Trump warned that Russia is ""playing with fire"" and hinted at potential consequences: ""What Vladimir Putin doesn’t realize is that if it weren’t for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD.""

The remarks prompted a pointed reaction from Moscow, with former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev interpreting them as a warning of possible escalation.

""Regarding Trump's words about Putin 'playing with fire' and 'really bad things' happening to Russia. I only know of one really bad thing — WWIII,"" Medvedev wrote on X on May 27. ""I hope Trump understands this!""

U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg hit back at Medvedev for his remarks, calling them ""reckless"" and ""unfitting of a world power.""

""President Trump... is working to stop this war and end the killing. We await receipt of (the Russian) Memorandum... that you promised a week ago. Cease fire now,"" Kellogg said on X.

According to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told him ahead of the Trump-Putin call that Moscow would prepare a draft outlining its requirements for a ceasefire. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova confirmed on May 27 that work on the document is ongoing. ""As soon as the memorandum is prepared, it will be handed over to Kyiv,"" she said.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179841418.jpg

U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg on May 27 criticized former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for comments that alluded to the threat of World War III, calling them ""reckless"" and ""unfitting of a world power.""

""President (Donald) Trump... is working to stop this war and end the killing. We await receipt of (the Russian) Memorandum... that you promised a week ago. Cease fire now,"" Kellogg said on X.

The envoy's remarks came in response to a tweet from Medvedev that referenced Trump’s recent warnings to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""Regarding Trump's words about Putin 'playing with fire' and 'really bad things' happening to Russia. I only know of one really bad thing — WWIII,"" Medvedev wrote. ""I hope Trump understands this!""

Medvedev's comments refer to Trump's recent posts on Truth Social, in which he reacted to Russia's weekend aerial attacks on Ukraine, including the largest drone assault since the start of the full-scale invasion. In the posts, Trump called Putin ""crazy"" and warned him that he was ""playing with fire.""

The U.S. president has increasingly voiced frustration with stalled peace efforts, signaling readiness to walk away from the process. Despite repeated threats of sanctions, Trump has not imposed any additional pressure on Moscow to push it toward a ceasefire agreement.

Russia has repeatedly rejected Kyiv and its Western partners' proposal for an unconditional ceasefire. Following Russian-Ukrainian negotiations in Istanbul on May 16, the Russian leadership said it would present a memorandum toward a peaceful settlement.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia's delays in presenting the document are a ""mockery of the whole world.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/04/GettyImages-2204329084.jpg

U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce advised Russia to focus less on President Donald Trump’s social media posts and more on ending its war against Ukraine.

""If the Russians cared about the nature of how [peace efforts are] proceeding, they would be thinking less about [the president’s statements] and more about what they could do – which is in their hands – to stop the carnage and the slaughter that’s happening right now,"" Bruce said during a May 27 press briefing.

Bruce's comments refer to Trump's recent posts on Truth Social, in which he reacted to Russia's weekend bombardment of Ukraine that killed at least 12 people. Trump called Russian President Vladimir Putin ""crazy"" and warned him that he was ""playing with fire.""

The Kremlin dismissed the remarks, calling Trump's statements the result of ""emotional overload.""

Bruce added that Trump's posts were a ""clear and completely transparent"" statement regarding his opinion of Russia's attacks on Ukraine, and she encouraged Russia to take him seriously.

Over the weekend, Russia launched the largest aerial assault on Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war in 2022, firing more than 600 drones and dozens of missiles across Ukraine. On May 26 alone, Russia reportedly launched 355 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys – the largest drone attack of the war.

Despite Trump's public criticism of Putin, there have been no concrete policy changes with regard to applying more pressure on Russia. Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers have called for tougher action on Russia and are prepared to pass a a bipartisan, ""bone-crushing"" sanctions bill that has yet to be endorsed by Trump.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/tammy.png

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on May 27 that Ukraine is fully mobilizing its domestic industrial base to scale up production of drones, missiles, and other weapons systems, as the country braces for continued large-scale Russian attacks.

From May 24 to 26, Russian forces fired more than 600 drones and dozens of missiles across Ukraine, with the third night amounting to the single largest drone attack of the full-scale war.

Zelensky's remarks followed a high-level meeting with Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, Chief of the General Staff Anatolii Hnatov, and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov.

""The agenda included planning our actions, our readiness to respond to Russian strikes, to their threats, and taking preventive measures, which means increasing the production of our drones and our missiles,"" the president said during his evening address.

He added that ""hundreds of Ukrainian companies are already producing results for Ukraine’s Defense Forces, with more to follow."" Zelensky said the government is fully mobilizing ""entrepreneurial capacity for weapons production"" and plans to sign new agreements with European partners to attract investment, focusing on unmanned systems and long-range capabilities.

While the government cannot publicly disclose its existing plans or capabilities, Zelensky emphasized that Ukraine must ""respond symmetrically to all Russian threats"" and Moscow must ""clearly feel the consequences of what they are doing against Ukraine. And they will.""

""Attack drones, interceptors, cruise missiles, Ukrainian ballistic systems – these are the key elements. We must manufacture all of them,"" he said.

In the meantime, the Trump administration has spent months trying to broker a peace deal in Ukraine. However, direct talks in Istanbul failed to yield a ceasefire, and during a May 19 phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin once again rejected calls for a 30-day truce.

Despite this, Trump has refused to impose new sanctions on Moscow so far, but said on May 25 that new sanctions could be on the table: ""I’ve always gotten along with him,"" Trump said of Putin. ""But he’s sending rockets into cities and killing people (...) We're in the middle of talking and he's shooting rockets into Kyiv and other cities.

Ukrainian military officials and defense analysts warn that Russia is preparing for a major offensive in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk Oblast this summer, aiming to seize the territory it has failed to fully control since 2022.

Some analysts interviewed by the Washington Post say the offensive has already begun, coinciding with stalled U.S.-brokered peace efforts and Moscow's rejection of repeated Western ceasefire calls. U.S. experts believe President Vladimir Putin remains convinced that a military victory is still possible, although continued sanctions and battlefield losses have strained Russia's capabilities.

Putin has long prioritized control over the entire Donetsk region, especially after failing to capture Kyiv early in the war. In September 2022, he declared Donetsk and three other partially occupied Ukrainian oblasts as part of the Russian Federation.

While Russia claims to seek peace, it insists that talks must address what it calls the ""root causes"" of the war. After direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul on May 16, both sides agreed to draft a memorandum outlining principles for a future settlement.

Analysts say that while the main offensive will focus on Donetsk—particularly the towns of Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka—Russia is also preparing smaller operations in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy and Kharkiv oblasts.

Mykola Bielieskov of Ukraine's National Institute for Strategic Studies told the Washington Post that Kostiantynivka remains a key target as it is a ""promising"" prospect for the Russian forces at present, he said, given Russia's ability to attack it from three directions. Despite past predictions that these towns would fall by late 2023, Ukrainian forces have continued to hold them through significant effort.

Ukraine, however, remains under strain due to recruitment shortfalls and limited firepower, while Russia has exceeded its military recruitment goals. Still, with around 125,000 troops on the Sumy and Kharkiv borders, Russia lacks the manpower for full-scale offensives in both regions, according to Ukrainian military intelligence.

Instead, Russia may attempt to seize small territories to create ""buffer zones,"" as described by Russian officials. Russian forces have already taken four villages in northeastern Sumy Oblast and aim to pressure regional centers like Sumy city.

Ukraine continues to focus on defense, aiming to inflict heavy losses on Russian forces rather than reclaim territory. This strategy hinges on sustained foreign weapons supplies, especially from the U.S., which are not guaranteed.

Europe has signaled increased support, with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz recently lifting restrictions on Ukraine's use of long-range weapons. Russia has seized on this move as proof that Europe opposes peace. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov responded to U.S. President Donald Trump's criticism of Russian airstrikes by saying Trump's frustration is directed at European leaders for allegedly undermining his peace efforts.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2113280448.jpg

After an unprecedented three-day wave of Russian aerial attacks in Ukraine over the weekend, the world is once again looking to U.S. President Donald Trump to take his first steps toward forcing Moscow to end its violence.

From May 24 to 26, Russian forces fired more than 600 drones and dozens of missiles across Ukraine, with the third night amounting to the single largest drone attack of the full-scale war.

In Ukraine, as well as being terrifying for those who experienced it, it was also a damning indictment of how ineffective the U.S.-led peace process has been so far.

""The Kremlin only understands the language of strength — sanctions, weapons, firm positions, and decisive action,"" Halyna Yanchenko, a lawmaker from the Servant of the People party, told the Kyiv Independent.

Since the attacks, Trump has used a lot of language, but is yet to show any strength. In a post on social media, he said Russian President Vladimir Putin had gone ""absolutely crazy"" and could be triggering ""the downfall of Russia,"" adding he was ""not happy"" with him.

But despite the rhetoric, one glaring fact remains — after 127 days in office, Trump has still not ended a war he claimed he would end within 100 days, and has yet to take a single concrete step to pressure the one person refusing to agree to the ceasefire he himself proposed — Putin.

On May 26, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that Trump is considering imposing sanctions on Russia this week, something he has previously opposed as it may hinder future business and trade opportunities.

A day later, Trump appeared to acknowledge the leverage he has over Putin but has so far failed to use, admitting in a post on social media that he was protecting Russia from ""really bad things.""

""What Vladimir Putin doesn't realize is that if it weren't for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean really bad. He's playing with fire,"" he wrote on Truth Social.

While Ukraine waits for Trump to finally follow through on his threats, there's no sign that Russia intends to stop the sort of mass missile and drone attacks that have rocked the country for years, but reached new levels of intensity over the weekend.

Russia has upgraded its ballistic missiles with radar decoys and evasive maneuvers, making them potentially harder to intercept even by Patriot air defenses, Ukraine's Air Force said on May 24.

Moscow's drone production continues to ramp up, with mass strikes employing ever more sophisticated tactics to reach Ukraine's cities.

""If we want that to change, we must cut off Russia’s ability to profit from war — by targeting its energy revenues, logistics, and military-industrial complex.""

And on the front lines, Kyiv has repeatedly warned about the threat of a new major Russian offensive targeting Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts this spring and summer.

And if that wasn't evidence enough, Kremlin officials have since a call last week between Trump and Putin given up any pretence of being interested in negotiations with Ukraine, or in a ceasefire, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov saying, ""we don't want this anymore.""

""​​The events of this past weekend are yet another reminder — you can’t make deals with Russia 'in a nice way,'"" Yanchenko said.

""No so-called 'constructive dialogue' or diplomatic politeness works with an aggressor that has been waging war against Ukraine for 11 years. If we want that to change, we must cut off Russia’s ability to profit from war — by targeting its energy revenues, logistics, and military-industrial complex,"" she added.



""The faster and more decisively we limit the flow of money into Russia's economy, the more likely Putin is to abandon his imperialist goals.""

With escalating aerial attacks on Ukraine, and Moscow gearing up for a renewed offensive, European capitals, particularly those geographically close to Russia, say the only way to end the war at this stage is through sanctions.

""Russia has repeatedly shown that it has no interest in peace. Its goal remains the destruction of Ukraine. This makes it clear that the pressure on Russia to stop the aggression has not been sufficient,"" Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsakhna told the Kyiv Independent.

Tsakhna highlighted preparations for the European Union’s 18th sanctions package, saying the ""war will only end when Russia faces strong pressure and is deprived of the resources needed to continue its aggression.""

""The faster and more decisively we limit the flow of money into Russia's economy, the more likely Putin is to abandon his imperialist goals,"" he added.

Finland’s Ambassador to Ukraine Tarja Fernández told the Kyiv Independent that the weekend's attacks showed that despite Trump's efforts to broker a peace in Ukraine, ""nothing has changed in Moscow.""

""Our basic line is to support Ukraine as long as needed and support further sanctions against Russia,"" she added.

French Senator Helene Conway-Moure told the Kyiv Independent it was essential that Europe ""shows Russia that we are united"" and step up sanctions that will ""put an end to their war economy.""

""These sanctions must be strong and respected, and must not only be imposed by the Europeans, but also by the Americans,"" she added.

There was a ray of hope among the gloom this week when on May 26, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz hinted at developments in the long-range missiles supplied by Western nations.

""There are no longer any restrictions on the range of weapons delivered to Ukraine — neither by the U.K., France, nor us. There are no restrictions by the U.S. either,"" he said.

Despite rowing back his statement a day later to clarify he was talking about the lifting of restrictions that happened last year, his use of the words ""nor us"" has once again opened up the debate over Germany's long-standing refusal to supply Ukraine with Taurus cruise missiles.

But even this came up against the reality facing Ukraine's increasingly stretched resistance to Russia's full-scale invasion.

""It's good news that they have lifted these restrictions on the use of missiles,"" Oleksandr Merezhko, a Ukrainian lawmaker and chair of the parliament’s foreign affairs committee, told the Kyiv Independent.

""But where are these missiles?""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2216837225.jpg

A vast majority of Russian-speaking Ukrainians — those how primarily speak Russian at home — view Russia negatively, according to a survey published on May 27 by Kyiv-based think tank Razumkov Center in cooperation with the Kyiv Security Forum.

The poll, conducted between April 24 and May 4, 2025, surveyed 2,021 Ukrainian citizens aged 18 and older in territories under Ukrainian government control. According to the survey, only 11% of respondents said they primarily speak Russian at home.

Of those, 82% said they had a negative view of Russia.

The results come as Russia continues to invoke the supposed plight of Russian-speaking communities to justify its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But the data suggests this narrative is widely rejected by those it claims to defend.

As recently as May 23, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed Moscow ""cannot leave"" Russian-speaking residents in Kyiv-controlled areas and would ""protect them.""

Only 13% of Russian-speaking respondents maintain a favorable opinion of Russia. By contrast, admiration for Western countries remains strong — 79% of respondents view France positively, and 75% feel the same about the United Kingdom.

The survey also found that 42% of respondents identified the European model of social development as the most attractive. Just 6% expressed a preference for the Russian model, further undermining Kremlin rhetoric about cultural and political alignment.

Support for Ukraine's military remains resilient. Some 81.5% of those surveyed said they trust the Armed Forces of Ukraine, a reflection of sustained public confidence despite ongoing Russian attacks. Only 14% expressed distrust.

Before the war, many of the cities now devastated by Russian attacks and occupation — Mariupol, Kharkiv, Sievierodonetsk — were predominantly Russian-speaking.

Rather than protection, these regions have endured mass displacement, forced deportations, and indiscriminate bombardment by Russian forces.

The war has also catalyzed a national shift in language use.

According to a 2024 Rating Group poll, 70% of Ukrainians now speak exclusively or primarily in Ukrainian at home — up from 50% in 2015 and 46% in 2006.

In 2014, just after Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, a separate Rating Group poll showed that 56% of Ukrainians already opposed granting Russian the status of a second state language.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1251192826-1.jpg

Trump's comments mark a rare public rebuke of Russian President Vladimir Putin amid growing pressure on the U.S. administration to respond to escalating Russian attacks.

On May 26, Russia launched its third large-scale aerial and drone assault against Ukraine in three nights, killing at least six people and injuring 24 across multiple oblasts.

The attack marked the most extensive drone strike against Ukraine during the full-scale war, topping the previous record of 298 drones overnight on May 25.

Trump recently held a two-hour phone call with Putin during which Russia reiterated its refusal to a full ceasefire in its war against Ukraine. Despite this, Trump has refused to impose new sanctions on Moscow, citing ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire.

""Because I think there's a chance of getting something done, and if you do that, you could also make it much worse,"" Trump said during a May 19 Oval Office briefing.

Trump has attempted to present himself as the only leader capable of ending the war quickly, though the lack of tangible pressure on Moscow has left Kyiv and its allies skeptical.

President Volodymyr Zelensky, responding to the May 25 overnight bombardment, called for urgent new sanctions and warned that ""America's silence, and the silence of others around the world, only encourages Putin.""

The European Union and U.S. lawmakers have also called for tougher action.

A bipartisan sanctions bill is already awaiting approval in Congress, with provisions for sweeping financial penalties and tariffs on nations buying Russian oil or uranium.

Russia builds power lines to connect occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant to its grid, NYT reports

Russia is constructing power lines in occupied southern Ukraine in an apparent attempt to link the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) to its energy grid, the New York Times reported on May 27, citing a new Greenpeace report.

The Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest nuclear facility in Europe and one of the ten largest globally, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022.

Satellite imagery included in the report shows that since early February 2025, Russian forces have laid over 80 kilometers (49 miles) of high-voltage lines between occupied Mariupol and Berdyansk, following the coastline of the Sea of Azov.

Greenpeace experts believe the construction aims to connect the new lines to a large substation near Mariupol, which could, in turn, be linked to the ZNPP, which is located some 225 kilometers (some 139 miles) away.

It sits in the city of Enerhodar in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Oblast, on the east bank of the Dnipro River, which remains under Russian control. Ukrainian authorities have no access to the site or its surrounding infrastructure.

Shaun Burnie, a nuclear specialist at Greenpeace, said that the satellite evidence offers the first concrete confirmation of Russian President Vladimir Putin's plans to restart the plant and permanently integrate it into Russia's grid.

The construction of power infrastructure indicates long-term intentions to seize full control of Ukraine's energy assets in the occupied regions.

Russia has repeatedly asserted ownership over the plant based on its illegal annexation of Zaporizhzhia Oblast in September 2022, despite the fact that Ukraine retains control over much of the oblast, including its administrative center.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly expressed concern over the safety of the plant, where shelling and the presence of armed troops have led to multiple emergency shutdowns and power disruptions.

The U.S. has reportedly proposed that control over the ZNPP be returned to Ukraine before transferring its management to the U.S. to supply electricity to areas under both Ukrainian and Russian control. Russia immediately rejected the suggestion.

US blocks G7 push to tighten Russian oil price cap, Financial Times reports

The United States opposed a joint G7 effort to lower the $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian oil exports during last week's meeting of finance ministers, the Financial Times reported on May 27, citing three unnamed officials familiar with the talks.

The price cap, introduced by the G7 and EU in December 2022, bans Western companies from shipping, insuring, or otherwise servicing Russian oil sold above $60 per barrel.

The mechanism was designed to limit the Kremlin's ability to finance its war against Ukraine.

The Canadian G7 presidency had proposed including language in the meeting's final communique that would call for tightening the existing price cap, according to the publication.

The move received backing from the European Union and G7 members France, Germany, Italy, and the U.K. However, the proposal was dropped after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly declined to support it.

The European Commission had planned to propose reducing the threshold to $50 per barrel ahead of the meeting, according to Reuters.

The Financial Times reported that some EU countries — including Hungary and Greece — were still weighing their support for lowering the cap further, possibly to $45, as part of the EU's upcoming 18th sanctions package.

Russia's Finance Ministry has leaned on oil and gas taxes to finance growing military expenditures, including aggressive campaigns against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.

Decision on lifting range restrictions on arms for Ukraine made months ago, Germany's Merz clarifies

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz clarified on May 27 that his comments on the West lifting range restrictions on arms for Ukraine referred to a step made months ago.

""The issue of limiting the range of deployed weapons played a role a few months and a few years ago. As far as I know, and as I said yesterday, the countries that imposed range limitations have long since abandoned these requirements,"" Merz said during a press conference with Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo in Turku.

""In this respect, yesterday in Berlin, I described something that has been happening for months: namely, that Ukraine has the right to use the weapons it receives, even beyond its own borders, against military targets on Russian territory.""

Speaking at a forum on May 26, Merz said that ""there are no longer any restrictions on the range of weapons delivered to Ukraine"" imposed by Germany, the U.S., the U.K., or France.

""This means that Ukraine can now defend itself, for example, by attacking military positions in Russia,"" the chancellor added. ""Until recently, it couldn’t do that, and apart from very few exceptions, it hadn’t done so either.""

Ukraine has previously received long-range missiles from the U.S., the U.K., and France — including ATACMS, Storm Shadow, and SCALP — but was initially permitted to deploy them only against Russian military forces in occupied Ukrainian territories.

Only in late 2024, the Biden administration and other allies eased the restrictions, allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles against Russian military targets on Russian territory.

Merz's comments on May 26 caused some confusion as to whether he was referring to a newly announced policy, drawing both praise and rebuke. Ralf Stegner, a politician from Merz's coalition partner, the Social Democratic Party (SPD), told the media the move was ""unhelpful"" and called instead for intensifying diplomatic efforts.

In turn, a former German defense minister and ex-leader of Merz's CDU party, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, praised Merz for his comments.

Merz's latest statement in Turku indicates that his earlier comment referred to the decision taken in late 2024 rather than a new policy. German Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil seemingly confirmed this, saying at a press conference that no new decision has been made ""beyond what the previous government has done.""

Before becoming chancellor, Merz signaled he would overturn the ban of his predecessor, Olaf Scholz, on the delivery of Germany's Taurus cruise missiles, capable of striking targets at a distance of 500 kilometers (300 miles). He has not confirmed whether he intends to deliver the missiles since taking office.

Russia changes drone tactics to bypass Ukraine's air defense, Air Force says

The Russian military has modified its tactics for launching attack drones against Ukraine in order to bypass air defenses, Ukraine's Air Force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat said in an interview with RBC Ukraine published on May 27.

Russia has been ramping up its drone production to launch ever-greater strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. The night of May 26 marked the most extensive drone attack of the full-scale war, reportedly involving 355 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys.

Russia's new tactic is to launch the drones at high altitudes, more than 2 kilometers (1.4 miles) above the ground, and keep changing the drones' routes. Then, the drones swoop down directly onto the target, Ihnat said.

""At this altitude, they become more visible to our radars, but remain out of reach of small arms, heavy machine guns, and mobile fire teams,"" the spokesperson explained.

Russian forces have also been conducting simultaneous group raids on the same residential area or facility, as well as using unmanned simulator drones called Parodiya (""a parody"" in English), increasing pressure on Ukraine's air defense systems.

Recent Russian drone attacks comprised roughly 60% of attack drones and 40% of Parodiya decoys, according to Ihnat.

Russia has been deploying Iranian-made Shaheds and their domestically-produced copies, Gerans, to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses in massive swarm attacks, allowing more destructive ballistic and cruise missiles to slip through.

The Economist previously reported that Russia uses Telegram messaging app bots to control its attack drones, ensuring real-time flight data and footage feed for human operators. The new control algorithm was revealed in a note hidden inside one of the Russian drones, possibly left behind by a ""sympathetic Russian engineer,"" according to the media outlet.

Ukraine's sky shield is increasingly stretched thin as Western air defense supplies are running out. An undisclosed source told Le Monde that Ukraine has run out of ammunition for its two SAMP/T air defense batteries, while the Crotale short-range anti-aircraft systems have not received new missiles for a year and a half.

It remains unclear how many U.S.-designed Patriot interceptors, which are key in intercepting Russian ballistic missiles, are left in Ukraine's stockpiles, as the Trump administration is yet to approve any new military aid packages.

Russia's Ministry of Labor and Social Protection has ordered more than 307,900 death certificates for families of soldiers killed since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, independent Russian outlet Verstka reported on May 27, citing official procurement data.

While such documents were issued before the war, Verstka noted that the scale of current purchases far exceeds pre-invasion levels. Before 2022, the number of certificates for deceased soldiers' relatives had consistently declined.

The records do not distinguish between service in Ukraine and other conflicts, though the spike in procurement coincides with Russia's massive losses in the war. Russia does not release official casualty numbers, but independent estimates indicate significant losses.

So far this year, the ministry has ordered 357,700 certificates — 317,500 for veterans and 40,200 for the families of fallen soldiers or those who died from war-related injuries.

According to the figures, the orders span the period from 2022 to 2025, with the largest volume placed in 2023, over 250,000 certificates for families of deceased servicemen and more than 800,000 for combat veterans.

The procurement numbers dropped sharply in 2024 before surging again in 2025.

Russian media outlet Mediazona, in partnership with the BBC's Russian service, has verified the identities of 109,625 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine, relying on open-source material such as obituaries, social media posts, and local news reports.

The investigators caution that the real death toll is much higher.

Ukraine's military places the number of Russian personnel killed or seriously wounded since the invasion at 982,840 as of May 27.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on May 27 that Moscow would welcome a second round of peace talks with Ukraine in Istanbul, he said during a joint press conference with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.

""If you ask me, I would turn to our Turkish friends again — Istanbul is very good,"" Lavrov said, according to state-owned news agency TASS.

The proposal comes as global diplomacy searches for a venue for negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow after the May 16 talks failed to achieve the ceasefire Ukraine has pushed for.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on May 19 that Ukraine is open to a new round of talks in Turkey, Switzerland, or the Vatican. Lavrov, however, cast doubt on the Vatican as a host, arguing that it would be an unsuitable platform for talks between ""Orthodox countries.""

The Turkish foreign minister, who met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kremlin negotiator Vladimir Medinsky during his visit, reaffirmed Ankara's readiness to facilitate future talks.

Fidan is expected to travel to Ukraine later this week following his two-day trip to Moscow.

Turkey previously hosted peace negotiations in March 2022. Since then, Ankara has maintained active contact with both Kyiv and Moscow and facilitated multiple prisoner exchanges, as well as the now-defunct Black Sea Grain Initiative.

No official date or venue for a second round of talks has been agreed. The renewed discussion about potential locations follows a May 19 call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin.

During the call, Putin rejected Ukraine's proposal for an immediate ceasefire and instead suggested preparing a ""memorandum"" outlining a future peace framework.

Since the call, Russia has launched one of its most intense waves of aerial attacks, including more than 600 drones and dozens of missiles over a single weekend.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2216731589.jpg

After Russia unleashed an unprecedented third consecutive night of mass missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian cities, U.S. President Donald Trump said his Russian counterpart had gone ""absolutely crazy"" and could be triggering ""the downfall of Russia.""

In later comments, the U.S. president said he was ""not happy with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,"" and when pressed by reporters, he vaguely alluded to the possibility of imposing further U.S. sanctions on the Kremlin.

Yet one glaring fact remains — despite months of resisting Trump's peace process, the U.S. has yet to take a single concrete step to pressure Putin into ending his full-scale invasion.

""This is not the kind of diplomacy Trump promised when he talked about 'peace through strength,'"" Daniel Fried, who served as U.S. assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs from 2005 to 2009, told the Kyiv Independent.

""It's the kind of weak diplomacy the Republicans used to make a meal of.""

Fried and other former senior U.S. officials who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said that even after the Kremlin's repeated refusals to agree to a ceasefire and escalating Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilians, Trump's rhetoric remains disconnected from meaningful action — and his recent diplomatic overtures may have done more to embolden the Kremlin than to restrain it.

Ceasefire talks

As Ukraine and its allies intensified efforts to end Russia's war, Trump and Putin held a phone call on May 19, during which Putin once again did not agree to a full ceasefire, despite calls from global leaders to do so.

Instead of a ceasefire, Putin offered to negotiate a ""memorandum regarding a potential future peace treaty"" with Ukraine without any clear timeline.

After the call, Trump briefed European leaders on the conversation, who were reportedly ""surprised"" the U.S. president was ""relatively content"" with what he heard from Putin.

""Putin remains interested in continuing the fighting. He doesn't want a ceasefire,"" John Herbst, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and current senior director at the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center, told the Kyiv Independent.

""He [Putin] would like to continue the war while not incurring any new American sanctions — and thus far he's winning.""

""And Trump has enabled Putin to maintain that position.""

Trump's description of the call as ""progress"" was also at odds with the Russian readout, which offered no substantive commitments and suggested only future discussions on terms — without any immediate ceasefire.

""This was a victory for Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Putin wants to continue the war,"" said Steven Pifer, another former ambassador to Ukraine and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

""He would like to continue the war while not incurring any new American sanctions — and thus far he's winning.""

What about the leverage?

All former officials interviewed noted that the Kremlin's demands remain maximalist and unacceptable to Ukraine.

Russia continues to insist on Ukraine accepting the loss of occupied Crimea, recognition of its occupation of four Ukrainian oblasts in their entirety despite Russia not fully controlling any of them, permanent neutrality for Kyiv, demilitarization, and regime change in Ukraine.

And while Putin has yet to offer a single concession that indicates any genuine intent for peace, Trump called the ""tone and spirit of the conversation"" with Putin ""excellent,"" claiming ""progress"" was made.

In reality, Kremlin officials have since the call given up any pretense of being interested in negotiations with Ukraine, or in a ceasefire, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov last week saying ""We don't want this anymore.""

After the unprecedented mass attacks on Ukraine over the weekend, those who spoke to the Kyiv Independent question why the U.S. response has so far remained constrained to strong words on social media with no real concrete action.

""Although Trump has substantial leverage that he could use to put pressure on Russia from things like tightening sanctions, moving to seize Russian frozen Central Bank assets, to giving or selling Ukraine more weapons, he's done none of that,"" Pifer told the Kyiv Independent.

""And Vladimir Putin doesn't care if Trump says he's unhappy about the slow pace of negotiations, as long as Trump does not take any steps to put pressure on Moscow,"" he added.

Fried agreed, stressing that the U.S. is the only player who can make a meaningful difference to Russia's approach.

""Without the threat of U.S. action, the Russians are not going to allow a ceasefire,"" he said.

""It's bad diplomacy to let Putin set the terms for talks or the schedule while he continues attacking Ukraine.""

Fried also expressed dismay at what he sees as a squandered opportunity.

""The Russian economy is not in great shape. The Russian advances in Ukraine are slow and costly. This is the time to press our advantage, not let it leak away,"" he said.

Europeans taking the lead

On May 26 it was reported that Trump is considering imposing sanctions on Moscow this week, but with nothing officially announced, and U.S. policy on Russia seemingly drifting, some suggest Europe may have to take the lead.

""We've now retreated from (sanctions),"" Fried said. ""It seems the Europeans and Ukraine need to figure out their Plan B, with an America that's sidelined itself.""

Pifer also noted the contrast between early transatlantic unity and the current diplomatic incoherence. ""I'd like to see the U.S. engaged in a positive and helpful way,"" he said, adding: ""But I don't see that happening under Trump's leadership.""

""It is not correct to say that the Ukrainians have no cards. They have arguably one of the best militaries in Europe.""

The issue took on extra urgency on May 27 when it was reported that U.S.-EU negotiations on coordinating the enforcement of sanctions against Russia have failed, making a future united strategy against Moscow uncertain.

Former Assistant Secretary of State and Executive Director of the George W. Bush Institute David Kramer noted that while ""Europeans still might move ahead with their sanctions, it's obviously much better if Europe and the United States are united on this.""

Kramer said the U.S. and Europe should impose additional sanctions and increase military assistance for Ukraine, putting Ukraine in a stronger position at the negotiating table when it comes to the real negotiations.

Referring to the remarks made in the Oval Office during the February meeting between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky — that Kyiv had ""no cards to play"" — Kramer firmly believes the opposite to be true.

""Ukrainians do have cards to play. It is not correct to say that the Ukrainians have no cards. They have arguably one of the best militaries in Europe,"" he said.

He added that Ukraine is in a decent position to negotiate, and they ""don't need to argue from a position of weakness, but they do need the help of the West.""

The former diplomats and officials still claim that there remains a sliver of hope — contingent largely on a shift in Trump's approach. Fried said Trump might grow ""tired of being played"" by Putin and eventually use the tools at his disposal.

Herbst expressed similar optimism. ""If Trump does what he said he'd do — press the side that refuses to compromise — that could open the door to real peace,"" he said.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2212611356-1.jpg

Editor's note: The story has been updated with the dates of Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's visit to Ukraine.

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan will visit Kyiv on May 29-30 after his two-day trip to Moscow, the Turkish media outlet Hurriyet reported on May 28.

Fidan is expected to meet Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Turkish official plans to discuss bilateral relations between the states, particularly in the areas of trade, energy, defense, and security, according to Hurriyet.

Fidan, whose country hosted the first direct peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in three years, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 26 to discuss recent peace initiatives and the May 16 talks in Istanbul, Reuters wrote.

The Istanbul negotiations ended without a breakthrough, as Moscow continues to reject Kyiv and the West's calls for an unconditional ceasefire. The only apparent tangible result of the talks was a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange, which concluded on May 25.

During his visit to Moscow, Turkey's top diplomat also met with Vladimir Medinsky, Putin's aide who led the Russian delegation in Istanbul, and with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

Turkey has acted as a mediator in the Russia-Ukraine war, hosting earlier unsuccessful peace talks in Istanbul in 2022 and maintaining close contact with Moscow and Kyiv. Reuters reported that the country has also offered to host a potential upcoming session of peace talks.

No venue or date for the next round of Russia-Ukraine negotiations has been set. Russia has dismissed Ukraine's suggestion that the Vatican could host the talks, and reportedly instead sees Turkey or some of the Gulf states as more suitable options.

International peace efforts show little progress as Russia continues to push for maximalist demands, including Ukraine's withdrawal from four partially occupied regions it claims to have annexed.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry on May 27 denied Ukraine's accusations that it supplies Russia with special chemical products, gunpowder, and components for the defense manufacturing industry.

China's reaction follows remarks by the head of Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service, Oleh Ivashchenko, about Beijing allegedly providing the said components to 20 Russian military-industrial manufacturing facilities.

Ivashchenko also mentioned that as of early 2025, 80% of critical electronic components used in Russian drones were of Chinese origin.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said China's position regarding the war in Ukraine remains ""consistent and clear.""

""We've been committed to bringing about a ceasefire and promoting talks for peace. China has never provided lethal weapons to any party to the conflict, and strictly controls dual-use items,"" Mao said during a press conference.

""Ukraine understands that well. China firmly opposes groundless accusations and political manipulation,"" she added.

China has strengthened ties with Russia since the Kremlin launched its full-scale war against Ukraine, becoming Moscow's leading supplier of dual-use goods that bolster Russia's defense industry.

While China has positioned itself as a potential mediator in the war, it has simultaneously criticized the U.S. and its allies for ""exacerbating"" the war by supplying weapons to Ukraine. NATO has labeled China a ""decisive enabler"" of Russia's aggression.

President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on April 17 that China is supplying weapons to the Russian military, marking Kyiv's first confirmation that Beijing supports Russia's war effort by direct arms supplies.

During Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow for Victory Day celebrations earlier this month, the two countries agreed to ""strengthen coordination in order to decisively counter Washington's course of 'dual containment' of Russia and China.""

Kyiv on April 22 presented Beijing with evidence that Chinese citizens and companies have participated in Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, which China dismissed as ""groundless accusations and political manipulations.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2159840692.jpg

Kyiv and London signed an agreement to use $3 billion profits from frozen Russian assets under the Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) initiative to cover the needs of the Ukrainian army and the Ukrainian defense industry, Ukraine's Defense Ministry announced on May 27.

The G7's ERA mechanism, totaling $50 billion, provides loans to Ukraine that will be repaid using future profits from frozen Russian assets.

The U.K. has pledged to lend Ukraine 2.26 billion pounds (around $3 billion) in three equal installments as part of the G7's ERA initiative. Ukraine received the first installment worth 752 million pounds ($970 million) on March 7.

The funds will be used to purchase foreign-made defense products, repair and maintain military equipment, implement joint projects with Ukrainian and international defense companies, and purchase other critical materials, including Ukrainian-made products, the statement read.

""Ukrainian enterprises have capacities worth $35 billion, but the lack of funds does not allow them to utilize them to the fullest,"" Deputy Strategic Industries Minister Davyd Aloian said.

""Therefore, attracting excess profits from frozen Russian assets will significantly boost the production and repair capacities of the Ukrainian defense industry.""

Since Russia's full-scale invasion began in 2022, G7 countries have frozen approximately $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets.

Moscow requested a meeting of the U.N. Security Council over Europe's alleged ""threats to international peace and security,"" Russia's U.N. envoy, Dmitry Polyansky, said on May 27, only a day after Russia launched its largest drone attack against Ukraine.

Russia launched a three-day wave of aerial attacks from May 24 to May 26, firing more than 600 drones and dozens of missiles across Ukraine. On May 26, Russian forces carried out the most extensive drone attack of the full-scale war, reportedly involving 355 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys.

Moscow, which holds a permanent seat in the U.N. Security Council, requested the session because of what it called attempts by European countries to prevent a peaceful settlement of the war in Ukraine, according to Polyansky.

Russia expects the meeting to be scheduled for May 30, one day after another Security Council meeting requested by Ukraine's European allies over the humanitarian situation in the war-torn country.

Ukraine and its European allies have repeatedly called for a complete ceasefire to bring the war to a close. Russia has consistently rejected these proposals, only escalating its attacks against Ukrainian cities and reportedly preparing a new offensive.

Russian President Vladimir Putin again refused to support a full ceasefire in Ukraine during a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump on May 19. Instead, the Kremlin proposed drafting a ""memorandum"" on a possible future peace settlement.

Recent peace talks in Istanbul, the first direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine since 2022, failed to achieve a breakthrough, with a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange seen as the only tangible result.

Hungary's European Affairs Minister Janos Boka said on May 27 that it is difficult to lead constructive negotiations with Ukraine on its EU accession, as Kyiv is allegedly conducting ""information and intelligence"" operations on Hungary's territory.

The statement comes after the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced on May 9 that it had dismantled a Hungarian military intelligence network operating in Ukraine's Zakarpattia Oblast, detaining two agents accused of espionage against the Ukrainian state.

The Hungarian government denied the accusation as a smear campaign and instead declared it had exposed two Ukrainian spies operating in Hungary. The controversy has put a further strain on an already fragile bilateral relationship.

Talking to journalists ahead of the EU General Affairs Council in Brussels on May 2, Boka said that constructive negotiations on Ukraine's entry to the EU would be difficult in this context.

Hungary, whose government is widely regarded as the most Russian-friendly in the EU, has been blocking the opening of accession negotiation clusters with Kyiv. After the scandal broke out, Budapest announced it is suspending talks with Ukraine on national minority rights, long presented by Hungary as the main roadblock in accession negotiations.

Budapest has repeatedly accused Kyiv of discriminating against the Hungarian ethnic minority concentrated in southwestern Zakarpattia Oblast, an accusation that the Ukrainian leadership denies. Much of these disputes center around Ukraine's language laws that require at least 70% of education above the fifth grade to be conducted in Ukrainian.

In turn, Kyiv has long accused Budapest of undermining Ukraine's sovereignty through political interference and dual citizenship schemes. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has also consistently obstructed sanctions against Russia and military aid for Ukraine within the EU.

Amid the escalating controversy, Orban has also accused Ukraine of meddling in Hungary's internal affairs and colluding with the Hungarian political opposition.

The agenda of the May 27 meeting in Brussels includes the possibility of stripping Hungary of its voting rights as the EU is looking for ways to override Budapest if it vetoes Ukraine's accession.

This will be the eighth hearing regarding Hungary since the European Parliament triggered Article 7 procedures against the country in 2018. Article 7 of the EU Treaty allows for the suspension of Council voting rights if a member state consistently breaches EU founding principles.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2211402072-1.jpg

The Russian military has modified its tactics for launching attack drones against Ukraine in order to bypass air defenses, Ukraine's Air Force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat said in an interview with RBC Ukraine published on May 27.

Russia has been ramping up its drone production to launch ever-greater strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. The night of May 26 marked the most extensive drone attack of the full-scale war, reportedly involving 355 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys.

Russia's new tactic is to launch the drones at high altitudes, more than 2 kilometers (1.4 miles) above the ground, and keep changing the drones' routes. Then, the drones swoop down directly onto the target, Ihnat said.

""At this altitude, they become more visible to our radars, but remain out of reach of small arms, heavy machine guns, and mobile fire teams,"" the spokesperson explained.

Russian forces have also been conducting simultaneous group raids on the same residential area or facility, as well as using unmanned simulator drones called Parodiya (""a parody"" in English), increasing pressure on Ukraine's air defense systems.

Recent Russian drone attacks comprised roughly 60% of attack drones and 40% of Parodiya decoys, according to Ihnat.

Russia has been deploying Iranian-made Shaheds and their domestically-produced copies, Gerans, to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses in massive swarm attacks, allowing more destructive ballistic and cruise missiles to slip through.

The Economist previously reported that Russia uses Telegram messaging app bots to control its attack drones, ensuring real-time flight data and footage feed for human operators. The new control algorithm was revealed in a note hidden inside one of the Russian drones, possibly left behind by a ""sympathetic Russian engineer,"" according to the media outlet.

Ukraine's sky shield is increasingly stretched thin as Western air defense supplies are running out. An undisclosed source told Le Monde that Ukraine has run out of ammunition for its two SAMP/T air defense batteries, while the Crotale short-range anti-aircraft systems have not received new missiles for a year and a half.

It remains unclear how many U.S.-designed Patriot interceptors, which are key in intercepting Russian ballistic missiles, are left in Ukraine's stockpiles, as the Trump administration is yet to approve any new military aid packages.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1619864803-1.jpg

Editor's note: The article was updated after the EU formally adopted the plan.

The EU formally adopted a 150-billion-euro ($170 billion) defense loan instrument amid Russia's war against Ukraine, the Council of the EU announced on May 27.

The EU reached an agreement to launch the $170 billion common defense fund on May 21 as Europe faces an increasingly challenging security environment. Russia continues to wage its war against Ukraine, and Europe is growing uncertain of U.S. security commitments to the continent.

The Security Action For Europe (SAFE) initiative will offer $170 billion in loans without counting towards EU fiscal spending limits.

SAFE is an EU loan instrument meant to prop up the continent's defense industry by financing weapons procurement to eligible countries. It also aims to ""boost production capacity, making sure defense equipment is available when needed, and to address existing capability gaps,"" the Council of the EU said in a statement.

""This is an unprecedented instrument which will boost our defense capabilities and support our defense industry. The more we invest in our security and defense, the better we deter those who wish us harm,"" said Adam Szlapka, Poland's European affairs minister.

The EU's member states, European Free Trade Association (EFTA) members, and Ukraine are eligible to borrow funds from the defense spending instrument.

The EU ""would effectively double the volume of weapons Ukraine receives"" by investing in domestic weapons production through the SAFE mechanism, EU Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius said on May 4.

""If (Russian President Vladimir) Putin isn’t convinced by (U.S. President Donald) Trump to make peace, we could bring forward more convincing arguments for peace very quickly — by greatly increasing our military support to Ukraine,"" Kubilius said.

The commissioner called for EU members to utilize the bloc's SAFE initiative to strengthen Ukraine in its fight against Russia's war.

The fund is part of the European Commission's ambitious ReArm Europe program, which allows member states to spend an additional 650 billion euros ($730 billion) on defense by loosening fiscal rules.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1882258789.jpg

At least 206 of the 5,000 Ukrainian soldiers repatriated to Ukraine died in Russian captivity, the Associated Press (AP) reported on May 27, citing Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (POWs) data.

There have been multiple reports of Ukrainian POWs being tortured or killed while in Russian captivity. As of May, the Prosecutor General's Office said criminal investigations were underway regarding the execution of 268 Ukrainian POWs.

Violence in Russian prisons is likely to have been one of the factors that caused a large number of deaths of Ukrainian POWs, the AP reported, citing previous reports of human rights groups, the United Nations, the Ukrainian government, and a Ukrainian forensic expert who conducted the autopsies of the POWs.

Out of 206 Ukrainian soldiers who died in captivity, more than 50 were killed during a Russian missile attack on Russia's notorious Olenivka POW camp in the occupied part of Donetsk Oblast.

Ukrainian authorities said that days before the explosion in the Olenivka prison, Russian occupation authorities singled out Ukrainian members of the Azov Regiment, who were captured in Mariupol and were awaiting a prisoner exchange, to a separate part of the prison building — the one that was destroyed.

The Prosecutor General's Office said that Russia likely used a thermobaric munition to strike the prison. Russia rejected the accusations and instead blamed the explosion on a Ukrainian HIMARS strike, an assertion rejected by the U.N.

In March, the U.N. confirmed 27 cases of executions by Russian troops, which resulted in the deaths of 84 Ukrainian soldiers since August 2024.

Victoria Tsymbaliuk, a representative of the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (POWs), said in October 2024 that at least 177 Ukrainian prisoners died in Russian captivity since the beginning of Moscow's full-scale invasion.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2146012439.jpg

Editor's note: The story was updated with a comment from German Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz clarified on May 27 that his comments on the West lifting range restrictions on arms for Ukraine referred to a step made months ago.

""The issue of limiting the range of deployed weapons played a role a few months and a few years ago. As far as I know, and as I said yesterday, the countries that imposed range limitations have long since abandoned these requirements,"" Merz said during a press conference with Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo in Turku.

""In this respect, yesterday in Berlin, I described something that has been happening for months: namely, that Ukraine has the right to use the weapons it receives, even beyond its own borders, against military targets on Russian territory.""

Speaking at a forum on May 26, Merz said that ""there are no longer any restrictions on the range of weapons delivered to Ukraine"" imposed by Germany, the U.S., the U.K., or France.

""This means that Ukraine can now defend itself, for example, by attacking military positions in Russia,"" the chancellor added. ""Until recently, it couldn’t do that, and apart from very few exceptions, it hadn’t done so either.""

Ukraine has previously received long-range missiles from the U.S., the U.K., and France — including ATACMS, Storm Shadow, and SCALP — but was initially permitted to deploy them only against Russian military forces in occupied Ukrainian territories.

Only in late 2024, the Biden administration and other allies eased the restrictions, allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles against Russian military targets on Russian territory.

Merz's comments on May 26 caused some confusion as to whether he was referring to a newly announced policy, drawing both praise and rebuke. Ralf Stegner, a politician from Merz's coalition partner, the Social Democratic Party (SPD), told the media the move was ""unhelpful"" and called instead for intensifying diplomatic efforts.

In turn, a former German defense minister and ex-leader of Merz's CDU party, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, praised Merz for his comments.

Merz's latest statement in Turku indicates that his earlier comment referred to the decision taken in late 2024 rather than a new policy. German Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil seemingly confirmed this, saying at a press conference that no new decision has been made ""beyond what the previous government has done.""

Before becoming chancellor, Merz signaled he would overturn the ban of his predecessor, Olaf Scholz, on the delivery of Germany's Taurus cruise missiles, capable of striking targets at a distance of 500 kilometers (300 miles). He has not confirmed whether he intends to deliver the missiles since taking office.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2216676784--1-.jpg

Editor's note: The article was updated with a response by Ukrainian sanctions official Vladyslav Vlasiuk.

The U.S.-EU negotiations on coordinating the enforcement of sanctions against Russia have failed, making a future united strategy against Moscow uncertain, the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) reported on May 27, citing an internal document from the German Foreign Ministry.

EU sanctions chief David O'Sullivan noted that there is ""no more outreach"" between the two sides on sanctions evasion and that G7 cooperation has ""also lost momentum"" in this regard, according to a report from an EU ministerial meeting in Brussels on May 20.

The story contrasts with earlier declarations by German officials that the EU's 18th sanctions package is being coordinated with Washington. European leaders have pledged to ramp up economic pressure on Moscow after it rejected proposals for a truce in Ukraine.

Ukrainian sanctions official Vladyslav Vlasiuk later disputed the article, calling its conclusion a ""big exaggeration.""

Vlasiuk noted that he meets regularly with his U.S. counterparts during joint working meetings in Europe, and while there may not be the same ""impetus"" due to the ""political context,"" there has been no breakdown in communication.

""As before, there is a lot of exchange of information and ideas within the sanctions coalition,"" Vlasiuk said on Facebook, highlighting that U.S. support will be key in convincing Hungary not to block the upcoming EU sanctions package.

Since the outbreak of the full-scale war, the U.S. has been a key player in enforcing the sanctions regime against Moscow, closely cooperating with the EU and G7 partners in cutting off Russia's supplies of military-use material and curtailing its economy.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who took office this January, has been inconsistent in his approach to sanctions against Russia.

While repeatedly threatening additional economic measures to pressure Moscow to peace talks, Trump reportedly told European leaders he would not impose any new sanctions after his phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, allegedly not wanting to endanger business opportunities with Russia.

More recently, after Trump sharply criticized Putin for strikes against Ukrainian cities, the Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. president is once again mulling new sanctions this week. Trump is reportedly also considering walking away from peace efforts unless progress is made.

According to the internal report cited by SZ, the current trade restrictions appear to have a significant impact on the Russian economy and have had some success in curtailing the flow of war-related goods via third-party countries and the activity of Russia's ""shadow fleet.""

The EU's upcoming 18th sanctions package could include measures to disconnect more than 20 Russian banks from SWIFT, lower the G7 oil price cap on Russian crude exports from $60 to around $45 per barrel, ban the Nord Stream gas pipelines, and impose approximately 2.5 billion euros ($2.84 billion) in new trade restrictions, Bloomberg reported last week.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/04/GettyImages-2207582593-1.jpg

Calin Georgescu, a Moscow-friendly Romanian politician who ran for president in November 2024, announced on May 26 that he is retiring from politics.

In a video address posted online, Georgescu said he had made a personal choice to become a mere ""observer of public and social life"" and devote more time and energy to his family.

An ultranationalist and a staunch opponent of NATO, Georgescu came first in the initial round of the presidential election in November 2024 with 22.9% of the vote. Romania's Constitutional Court later annulled the vote due to credible evidence of foreign interference in Georgescu's favor, namely from Russia.

Georgescu was later barred from participating in a rerun in May as he faces multiple criminal charges over suspected promotion of fascist ideologies and Romania's World War II-era leader, Ion Antonescu, who oversaw the Holocaust in the country.

In his address, Georgescu said that after the presidential election, ""this stage of the sovereignist movement has ended."" He added he would not join any political party or seek to hold a political office.

After Georgescu was banned from running for president, far-right Eurosceptic George Simion became the leading nationalist candidate instead but was defeated in the runoff on May 18 by pro-EU centrist Nicusor Dan.

""The world is weary of conflict, war, haste, violence, and political excess,"" Georgescu said.

""When public attention is consumed by political infighting that has little to do with society's well-being, those in professions vital to the country's welfare are pushed to the margins.""

Georgescu thanked all those who supported him, claiming they had been ""harassed, humiliated, and marginalized,"" and extended his gratitude also to his opponents.

The largely unknown Georgescu surged in popularity shortly before the November vote thanks to what is suspected to be Russian interference and a hybrid campaign on the TikTok platform.

Russia launched over 900 strike drones over the last three days, in addition to cruise and ballistic missiles, Zelensky said.

""Over 900 attack drones launched against Ukraine in just three days, along with ballistic and cruise missiles. There is no military logic in this, but it is a clear political choice — the choice of Putin, the choice of Russia — the choice to keep waging war and destroying lives.""

Ukraine and Russia held peace talks in Istanbul on May 16, where both sides agreed to a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange.

The peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia were largely inconclusive, with Moscow reiterating maximalist demands and sending a delegation of lower-level officials.

Despite the peace talks in Turkey, Russia has intensified drone and missile attacks against Ukraine.

Flight restrictions have been introduced at airports in the Russian cities of Nizhny Novgorod, Saratov, and Tambov amid the threat of drone attacks, Artyom Korenyako, a spokesperson for Russia's state aviation agency Rosaviatsia, said on May 27.

""To ensure the safety of civil aircraft flights, temporary restrictions on their entry and exit have also been introduced,"" Korenyako said in a Telegram post.

As Russia continues its war, Ukraine regularly strikes military facilities deep within Russian territory to minimize Moscow's ability to wage its war.

Earlier on May 27, the Russian aviation agency said it imposed flight restrictions at Kaluga's airport.

Air defenses ""have detected and destroyed"" several drones, Alexander Gusev, Voronezh Oblast Governor, said.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims.

The threat of drone attacks was declared in Russia's Tula, Lipetsk, Samara, and Voronezh oblasts by Russian authorities.

On May 23, Russian authorities were forced to shut down airports in Moscow amid a barrage of Ukrainian drone strikes overnight.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on May 26 said Ukraine's Western partners are no longer imposing any range restrictions on weapons delivered to Kyiv for use against Russian military targets.

""There are no longer any restrictions on the range of weapons delivered to Ukraine — neither by the U.K., France, nor us. There are no restrictions by the U.S. either,"" Merz said.

U.S. President Donald Trump's recent comments criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin are the result of ""emotional overload,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on May 26.

The previous day, Trump wrote on social media that Putin had gone ""absolutely crazy"" and could be triggering ""the downfall of Russia."" The comments came after Russia heavily bombarded Ukrainian cities for three consecutive nights.

When asked about Trump's criticism of Russia's mass attacks, Peskov thanked Trump for his involvement in peace negotiations and attributed the U.S. president's comments to emotion.

""We are really grateful to the Americans and to President Trump personally for their assistance in organizing and launching this negotiation process,"" Peskov said, according to the Russian state news agency TASS.

""Of course, at the same time, this is a very crucial moment, which is associated, of course, with the emotional overload of everyone absolutely and with emotional reactions.""

The Trump administration has been attempting to secure a peace deal in Ukraine for months, after campaigning on promises to end the war in 24 hours if elected. Direct negotiations in Istanbul failed to produce a ceasefire agreement and Putin once again rejected calls for a 30-day truce in a phone conversation with Trump on May 19.

Instead, Putin offered to present a ""memorandum regarding a potential future peace treaty"" — something the Kremlin has yet to deliver.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia would submit a document outlining its settlement terms after Ukraine and Russia concluded their 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange. The swap was completed on May 25.

Peskov said on May 26 that Russia was still ""working on the text of a memorandum.""

Trump has previously criticized Putin and threatened sanctions against Moscow in public comments, but has not gone so far as to impose actual penalties on Russia.

Russia has consistently refused to accept international calls for an unconditional ceasefire, insisting that it will only impose such a truce if Ukraine stops receiving all foreign military aid, among other extreme concessions. Ukraine has been ready to declare a 30-day ceasefire since March, when the U.S. first proposed a month-long truce.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2216368532.jpg

Four settlements along the border of Ukraine's northeastern Sumy Oblast have come under Russian control, regional Governor Oleh Hryhorov reported on May 26.

Sumy Oblast, which borders Russia to the north, has been a repeated target of Russian incursions and shelling since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. The region has recently seen renewed hostilities as Russian forces ramp up activity along the northeastern border.

Russian forces control the border villages of Novenke, Zhuravka, Veselivka, and Basivka, Hryhorov announced on May 26.

""Residents of these villages were evacuated long ago, and there is no threat to civilians,"" he said.

The now-occupied villages were previously considered part of the ""gray zone,"" areas with contested or unclear military control.

According to Hryhorov, Russia is continuing attempts to advance in Sumy Oblast ""to create a so-called 'buffer zone.'"" Fighting remains ongoing near the communities of Vodolahy, Yunakivka, and Khotin.

""The Ukrainian Defense Forces and all components of the defense forces are keeping the situation under control, inflicting precision fire on the enemy,"" Hryhorov said. ""Our defenders are resolutely repelling the enemy's attacks and preventing them from advancing deeper into Sumy Oblast.""

Less than a week earlier, Hryhorov announced that around 56,000 civilians had been evacuated from the region amid escalating Russian aggression. Along with daily attacks, Russia has been deploying assault groups to Sumy Oblast throughout spring 2025 in attempts to expand the front line.

Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed on May 22 that Moscow is already working to establish a ""security buffer zone"" along the border with Ukraine, including near Sumy Oblast.

Germany is planning to send Ukraine older PAC-2 Patriot missiles to replenish its dwindling stockpiles of air defense ammunition, the Washington Post (WP) reported on May 26, citing a European diplomat.

The U.S.-made Patriot air defense system is widely recognized for its high-precision detection, tracking, and interception of aircraft, cruise, and ballistic missiles. Kyiv is running out of ammunition for its Patriots as Russia intensifies its drone and missile attacks.

In early May, the U.S. authorized Germany to transfer 100 Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine. Speaking to the WP anonymously, a European diplomat in Kyiv said that Berlin plans to send older PAC-2 missiles, which are less effective at intercepting ballistic missiles than the newer PAC-3 Patriots.

A senior Ukrainian intelligence official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that even PAC-3 missiles cannot intercept Russia's Oreshnik, the new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) Moscow used to attack the city of Dnipro in November.

The European diplomat added that the only other air defense weapon potentially capable of shooting down ballistics is the Aster, a French-Italian missile. This capability has not yet been proven, he said.

The more modern PAC-3 missiles are designed with ""hit-to-kill"" precision targeting technology, which the older PAC-2s lack. PAC-3s are also smaller, lighter, and more manueverable than PAC-2 missiles. A standard Patriot launcher can fit 16 PAC-3s at once, compared to only four PAC-2s.

The claim that Germany's latest air defense package may consist of less effective missiles comes after Ukraine endured three consecutive nights of large-scale Russian attacks. Moscow bombarded Kyiv and other cities with ballistic and cruise missiles while also launching a record number of drones at Ukraine.

After the first attack, Air Force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat said that Russia has upgraded its ballistic missiles with radar decoys and evasive maneuvers, making them potentially harder to intercept even by Patriot systems.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has offered to buy 10 Patriot batteries from Washington, but U.S. President Donald Trump dismissed the request. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on May 20 that Washington is looking for other NATO nations to supply Ukraine with additional Patriots.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-1246864675.jpg

Russia is ""preparing new offensive operations"" in its full-scale war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on May 26, following an intelligence briefing.

Kyiv has previously warned about the threat of a new major Russian offensive targeting Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts this spring and summer. While Russia has made only minimal territorial gains at the cost of heavy losses over the last several months, Moscow has doubled down on its maximalist objectives in recent peace talks.

Ukrainian intelligence reports confirm that Russia is not seriously interested in a peace settlement, Zelensky said in his evening address on May 26.

""We can see from the information that our intelligence is gathering and from open data that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and his entourage have no plans to end the war — there is no evidence that they are seriously considering peace and that they are seriously considering diplomacy,"" he said.

""On the contrary, there is a lot of evidence that they are preparing new offensive operations.""

The intelligence agencies of Ukraine's allies have likely seen the same evidence, Zelensky said. He urged partner nations to apply ""appropriate joint pressure"" on Moscow in response.

Zelensky's latest remarks come after three nights of relentless Russian aerial attacks against Ukrainian cities — launched while the Kremlin drags its feet in delivering the terms of its proposed ""memorandum"" on a possible future peace settlement.

The memorandum was Putin's counteroffer after he again rejected a ceasefire in a two-hour phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump on May 19. Russia has still not delivered the document presenting its settlement terms.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia would only submit the draft ""settlement document"" after Ukraine and Russia concluded their 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange. The swap was completed on May 25.

Zelensky called attention to Russia's delay in submitting the memorandum.

""They have spent more than a week on this,"" he said. ""They talk a lot about diplomacy. But when in the midst of this, there are constant Russian strikes, constant killings, constant assaults, and preparations for new offensives, this is definitely a diagnosis. Russia deserves full-scale pressure — everything that can be done to limit their military capabilities.""

According to Zelensky, Russia launched over 900 strike drones over the last three days, in addition to cruise and ballistic missiles. Ukraine is looking to increase its production of interceptor drones and direct additional funding to developing its ballistic missile program, he said.

Officials and experts told the Washington Post (WP) on May 24 that Russia likely lacks the military capability to mount an offensive that could successfully break Ukraine's lines. The decline in Russia's military advantage could make coordinated Western pressure on the Kremlin more effective, officials said.

Zelensky urged the U.S. and Europe to enact ""new and strong sanctions"" against Moscow to force Putin to accept a ceasefire and show ""respect"" for the diplomatic process.

Ukraine secures release of POWs from units excluded from all previous swaps

LATEST: Decision on lifting range restrictions on arms for Ukraine made months ago, Germany's Merz clarifies.

Western partners are not imposing any range restrictions on weapons delivered to Ukraine for use against Russian military targets, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on May 26.

""There are no longer any restrictions on the range of weapons delivered to Ukraine — neither by the U.K., France, nor us. There are no restrictions by the U.S. either,"" Merz said during a discussion forum organized by the WDR channel.

""This means that Ukraine can now defend itself, for example, by attacking military positions in Russia,"" the chancellor added. ""Until recently, it couldn’t do that, and apart from very few exceptions, it hadn’t done so either.""

Ukraine has previously received long-range missiles from the U.S., the U.K., and France — including ATACMS, Storm Shadow, and SCALP — but was initially permitted to deploy them only against Russian military forces in occupied Ukrainian territories.

Only in late 2024, the Biden administration and other allies eased the restrictions, allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles against Russian military targets in border regions. U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized ex-President Joe Biden's decision to ease the restrictions as he seeks to negotiate a peace agreement between Kyiv and Moscow.

The German chancellor also stressed that while Ukraine is using its arms to target Russian military infrastructure, Russia continues to attack Ukrainian ""cities, kindergartens, hospitals, and care homes.""

Before becoming chancellor, Merz signaled he would overturn the ban of his predecessor, Olaf Scholz, on the delivery of Germany's Taurus cruise missiles, capable of striking targets at a distance of 500 kilometers (300 miles). He has not confirmed whether he intends to deliver the missiles since taking office.

Possible targets for Ukraine's long-range missile strikes on Russia (The Kyiv Independent)

Russia launches record 355 drones at Ukraine; 6 killed, 24 injured over past 24 hours

Russia launched its third large-scale aerial and drone assault against Ukraine in three nights, killing at least six people and injuring 24 across multiple oblasts over the past 24 hours, regional authorities reported on May 26.

Moscow's forces launched nine Kh-101 cruise missiles from Tu-95MS bomber planes and a record number of 355 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys overnight, Ukraine's Air Force reported.

Ukrainian air defenses shot down all nine missiles and 233 drones, and 55 Russian drones were neutralized by electronic warfare systems or disappeared from radars, according to the statement.

The attack marked the most extensive drone strike against Ukraine during the full-scale war, topping the previous record of 298 drones overnight on May 25.

Russia launched a three-day wave of aerial attacks from May 24 to May 26, firing more than 600 drones and dozens of missiles across Ukraine.

Trump, who has repeatedly pressed for a ceasefire and held a two-hour phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 19, expressed strong disapproval of the latest escalation.

""I'm not happy with Putin,"" he told reporters on May 25, adding on Truth Social that the Russian president has gone ""absolutely"" crazy.

""I've always said that he wants all of Ukraine, not just a piece of it, and maybe that's proving to be right,"" Trump wrote. ""But if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia!""

Despite acknowledging Putin's escalatory behavior, Trump also criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky, with whom he has had a strained relationship.

Zelensky on May 25 condemned the U.S. for its lack of response to the massive Russian assault, calling for stronger sanctions and saying that ""America's silence... only encourages Putin.""

""Likewise, President Zelensky is doing his country no favors by talking the way he does,"" Trump posted. ""Everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don't like it, and it better stop.""

Russian drone production site, chemical plant targeted in alleged Ukrainian drone strike

Russian air defenses opened fire against drones near the Yelabuga drone production site in Russia's Tatarstan Republic, while other drones attacked a chemical plant in Ivanovo Oblast, independent news channel Astra reported on May 26.

The reported attacks against Russian industrial facilities come as Moscow intensifies its aerial strikes against Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv.

Local residents reported air defense fire and drones flying over Yelabuga city on May 25, Astra and Baza Telegram channels wrote. The so-called Alabuga Special Economic Zone hosts a factory producing Shahed-type drones and has been repeatedly targeted by Ukrainian forces throughout the full-scale war.

It is unclear whether the facility, lying some 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border, suffered any damage in the May 25 attack.

In Ivanovo Oblast, local authorities reported intercepting a drone attack in the town of Kineshma, with drone wreckage falling in the industrial area. No casualties were reported.

The drones targeted the town's Dmitrievsky Chemical Plant, Astra reported, citing residents. The facility produces components for Russian arms, namely missiles, Ukrainian official Andrii Kovalenko said.

Kineshma lies around 750 kilometers (470 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border.

At least 10 explosions were also reported in Russia's Tula Oblast overnight. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed its forces had downed 148 Ukrainian drones between 10 a.m. local time on May 25 and 8 a.m. on May 26.

A Ukrainian drone attack also reportedly targeted Moscow on May 25, local authorities claimed. The airports in Moscow, Nizhnekamsk, and Kaluga have temporarily suspended operations, Russian authorities said.

Ukraine's military has not yet commented on the attacks, and the Kyiv Independent could not verify claims provided by Russian officials.

Netherlands to send last of pledged 24 F-16s to Ukraine on May 26

The Netherlands will send the remainder of the 24 F-16 fighter jets it had promised to Ukraine on May 26, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said on the Dutch broadcaster WNL on May 25.

Ukraine received its first F-16 jets from the Netherlands and Denmark in 2024. The U.S.-made fourth-generation fighter jets have been deployed to bolster Ukraine's sky shield and help repel Russian aerial attacks.

""We are also training pilots and technicians and sharing our military doctrines, so that Ukraine can build a modern armed force that matches that of the NATO member states,"" Brekelmans said on air.

Later in the day, the Dutch Defense Ministry confirmed the shipment of the final batch of 24 F-16 fighter jets bound for Ukraine.

According to a statement on the ministry's official website, ""The aircraft left Volkel Air Base today for Belgium, where they are being prepared for delivery (to Ukraine).""

Apart from the Dutch aircraft, Ukraine has been promised 19 F-16s by Denmark, 30 by Belgium, and at least six from Norway. European nations have agreed to supply aircraft to help modernize the Ukrainian Air Force as they themselves transition to more advanced F-35 fighter jets.

The F-16 aircraft are being provided within the framework of the international fighter jet coalition, with some partners contributing training and technical support.

Oslo announced earlier this month that it would complete the delivery of its planes by the end of 2025. Similarly, the Belgian government said it would provide its aircraft sooner than the 2028 deadline.

Ukraine has confirmed that it has lost three of its F-16 jets in action.

Ukraine secures release of POWs from units excluded from all previous swaps

As part of the 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange with Russia, Ukraine has recovered soldiers from 46 military units that had previously seen none of their members returned, the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (POW) reported on May 26.

""The return of fighters from these units has long been blocked by the Russian side for various reasons,"" the agency said in a statement, describing the outcome as a significant breakthrough.

Of the 1,000 Ukrainian service members repatriated, over 300 had been held in Russian captivity since 2022. All those returned were soldiers or sergeants, many of whom had fought in the most intense areas of the front line, the agency added.

The exchange — agreed during the May 16 peace talks in Istanbul — was carried out in three phases between May 23 and 25.

It marked the largest single prisoner swap during the war and the only concrete result from the first direct negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow in nearly three years.

The high-profile operation has drawn a mix of relief and frustration in Ukraine.

Colonel Denys Prokopenko, commander of the 1st Azov Corps, criticized the exchange as a ""mockery,"" noting that no Azov fighters were included in the release.

Thousands of civilians and military families have spent two years campaigning for the release of Azov servicemen captured during the siege of Mariupol in 2022. The omission has sparked renewed anger among Ukrainians who view Azovstal defenders as national heroes.

The then-Azov Brigade's last stand at the Azovstal steel plant is widely credited with delaying Russia's early advance, giving Ukraine time to mobilize and secure international military support.

Andrii Yusov, military intelligence spokesperson and deputy head of Ukraine's POW Coordination Headquarters, emphasized that Kyiv had no influence over which individuals Russia chose to release during the process.

""We could not influence the list. Russia handed over who it was ready to hand over, and Ukraine as well,"" Yusov said on May 26.

While Ukraine has previously conducted smaller prisoner exchanges, often with the involvement of third-party mediators, the Istanbul-negotiated swap was unprecedented in scale and complexity.

Kyiv has long advocated for an ""all-for-all"" exchange, but Moscow has so far rejected the proposal.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 26 called for punitive action against Western companies still operating in Russia, saying they must be ""strangled"" in response to what he described as Western attempts to suffocate the Russian economy.

""We should strangle them. I agree completely. I'm speaking without any shame, because they're trying to strangle us. We need to reciprocate,"" Putin said during a meeting with Russian entrepreneurs.

The remarks came in response to a proposal from one business representative to ""slightly"" restrict the work of remaining Western companies, naming Microsoft and Zoom as examples.

The participant claimed, citing unnamed analysts, that Russia's IT industry was losing billions due to continued reliance on foreign services. Putin took the suggestion further, urging the government to identify those still using Western software.

""Give us everyone who can't get rid of these bad habits. I'm not kidding, seriously,"" he said.

Following the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, hundreds of Western companies exited Russia or suspended operations under public pressure and legal sanctions.

According to data from the Kyiv School of Economics, 472 foreign firms have fully withdrawn from Russia, while another 1,360 have scaled back their operations.

In some cases, Moscow has directly seized assets from companies that remained in the country. The Kremlin's increasingly hostile approach has been viewed as retaliation for freezing around $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets abroad.

Despite the rhetoric, Russia continues to explore paths for re-engagement with foreign businesses. In February, Putin instructed his government to prepare for the eventual return of Western firms.

Still, no formal requests have been received from companies seeking re-entry, according to Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council and former president.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2216554864-1.jpg

As Russia continues to bombard cities and towns across Ukraine, Russian officials have hardened their position against a ceasefire, continuing to repeat the obscure demand that the war’s ""root causes"" be addressed before agreeing to any truce.

For months, the phrase ""root causes"" has become a go-to talking point repeated by Russian President Vladimir Putin and his deputies, including Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, to justify their continued aggression.

""In (Russia’s) telling, they ascribe these root causes to an aggressive West,"" said Robert Person, an expert on Russian foreign policy and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).

""The most concrete thing that you’ll hear, when they’re talking about the root causes that they refer to, is the enlargement of NATO.""

Russia has named the alleged threat from NATO in its attempts to justify its invasion of Ukraine, among other reasons, and has demanded that a peace agreement include a ban on Ukraine ever joining the alliance.

But Russia’s framing is a red herring, Person and other experts argue.

""What Putin is after in Ukraine and beyond is not just a rollback of the prospect of NATO membership. It’s not about securing Ukraine’s neutrality,"" he said. ""It’s really about turning Ukraine into a subservient vassal state with a puppet government that does his bidding.""

The false narratives serve a useful purpose for Russia’s government, however, said Mercedes Sapuppo, assistant director in the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center.

""When Putin discusses the 'root causes' of his war, he is calling up a framework that he claims justifies Russia's aggression in Ukraine by falsely placing blame on Ukraine,"" said Sapuppo. ""Putin and the Kremlin are using these narratives to frame Ukraine as the instigator of the Kremlin’s war.""

Even U.S. President Donald Trump has bought into the idea, saying as recently as last month, ""I think what caused the war to start was when (Ukraine) started talking about joining NATO.""

NATO: a ‘nonsensical’ explanation for the war

Alongside NATO expansion, Russia has at times named additional reasons for its invasion — including propaganda claims of Nazi extremism, and protecting the status of Russian language speakers or the Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church — but it has placed outsized emphasis on NATO.

In 2018, Ukraine enshrined its goal of NATO membership in its constitution and has since argued that membership in the security alliance is needed in the future to deter further Russian aggression.

Yet the idea that NATO is the root cause of this conflict is ""nonsensical,"" said Stephen Hall, assistant professor in Russian and post-Soviet politics at the University of Bath.

""It’s a narrative that’s pushed by the Kremlin to try and get so-called 'useful idiots' to play it up in the media and elsewhere.""

One sign that Putin’s concerns go beyond NATO, notes Hall, is the limited resistance that Russia put up when Poland joined NATO in 1999 and when Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia followed in 2004 — four countries that share a border with Russia.

""Then fast forward to when the state with the longest border (in NATO) with Russia, Finland, joins in 2023. There’s barely a peep from Moscow,"" he added.

While NATO is relevant, it is only in highlighting to Putin that Ukraine is slipping away from Russian influence, Hall said. Additionally, if Ukraine were to make independent decisions based on the will of its people, it could send a signal to Russian citizens that democracy is a viable option for them, as well.

""That, obviously, is a problem for Putin’s autocracy, or any autocracy for that matter,"" Hall said.

""It’s very clear that the root cause for him, really, is just Ukraine’s existence.""

Before Russia’s 2014 invasion, the idea of NATO membership was deeply unpopular with Ukrainian citizens, with only around 15 to 20% of Ukrainians supporting it at the time.

Since Russia’s invasion, however, support has skyrocketed. According to a poll last year by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, 84% of Ukrainians would like to see their country join NATO.

Evidence that NATO is a smokescreen for Putin’s motivations is seen not just in how Putin treats other NATO members, but also how it has treated Ukraine for decades, Person of CFR said.

""For over twenty years, Putin has very aggressively been targeting Ukrainian sovereignty and Ukrainian democracy,"" Person said, citing Putin’s interference in Ukraine during the 2004 Orange Revolution as an example.

In the lead-up to the Orange Revolution, Putin heavily promoted pro-Russian candidate Viktor Yanukovych ahead of the 2004 presidential election, including visiting Ukraine to push his preferred candidate. His attempts to interfere with Ukraine’s politics prompted a backlash, helping to spark protests over a rigged election that resulted in Yanukovych’s defeat.

""Then in 2014, when Russia invaded Crimea, when they invaded the Donbas, membership in NATO was nowhere on the immediate agenda — for NATO or Ukraine. There was a constitutional provision at the time that prohibited it, and required neutrality,"" Person noted. ""How does that somehow spark or cause the Russian invasion of 2014?""

What this means for peace negotiations

Sapuppo, of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center, says understanding Putin’s motivation for the war is necessary for informing the West’s strategies for negotiations with the Russian leader.

""It’s very clear that the root cause for (Putin), really, is just Ukraine’s existence. This should make it clear to Western leaders that any agreements to end the war need to be very forward-looking when it comes to security guarantees,"" she said.

If Western leaders were to fall into the trap of focusing on NATO limitations, this would not only fail to address the true reasons for the invasion, but would also allow Russia to establish a revisionist history, she said.

But recognizing the underlying motives for Russia’s invasion also means recognizing that they are far more difficult to solve than a question of neutrality, Person added.

""You could draw lines on a map all day long. No line, unless it incorporates, at least all of Ukraine up to and including Kyiv and its government, is going to satisfy Putin’s demands,"" he said.

""At the end of the day, what Putin cannot tolerate is a sovereign Ukraine that chooses its own foreign policies and partnerships, its own economic relationships.""

As part of the 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange with Russia, Ukraine has recovered soldiers from 46 military units that had previously seen none of their members returned, the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (POW) reported on May 26.

""The return of fighters from these units has long been blocked by the Russian side for various reasons,"" the agency said in a statement, describing the outcome as a significant breakthrough.

Of the 1,000 Ukrainian service members repatriated, over 300 had been held in Russian captivity since 2022. All those returned were soldiers or sergeants, many of whom had fought in the most intense areas of the front line, the agency added.

The exchange — agreed during the May 16 peace talks in Istanbul — was carried out in three phases between May 23 and 25.

It marked the largest single prisoner swap during the war and the only concrete result from the first direct negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow in nearly three years.

The high-profile operation has drawn a mix of relief and frustration in Ukraine.

Colonel Denys Prokopenko, commander of the 1st Azov Corps, criticized the exchange as a ""mockery,"" noting that no Azov fighters were included in the release.

Thousands of civilians and military families have spent two years campaigning for the release of Azov servicemen captured during the siege of Mariupol in 2022. The omission has sparked renewed anger among Ukrainians who view Azovstal defenders as national heroes.

The then Azov Brigade's last stand at the Azovstal steel plant is widely credited with delaying Russia's early advance, giving Ukraine time to mobilize and secure international military support.

Andrii Yusov, military intelligence spokesperson and deputy head of Ukraine's POW Coordination Headquarters, emphasized that Kyiv had no influence over which individuals Russia chose to release during the process.

""We could not influence the list. Russia handed over who it was ready to hand over, and Ukraine as well,"" Yusov said on May 26.

While Ukraine has previously conducted smaller prisoner exchanges, often with the involvement of third-party mediators, the Istanbul-negotiated swap was unprecedented in scale and complexity.

Kyiv has long advocated for an ""all-for-all"" exchange, but Moscow has so far rejected the proposal.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/IMG_0944.jpg

Latvia is calling on all EU member states to suspend the issuance of visas to Russian citizens, citing rising security threats from Moscow, Foreign Minister Baiba Braze announced on May 25.

While some EU countries have restricted or halted visa issuance to Russian citizens, others have continued processing applications, keeping a legal pathway open for Russian travel to the bloc.

""Latvia calls on the EU countries to halt visa issuance for Russian citizens, citing security concerns,"" Braze posted on X. She noted that the number of Schengen visas issued to Russian nationals increased by 25% in 2024 compared to the previous year.

The Schengen visa allows holders to travel freely across 29 European countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period, enabling short-term visits for tourism, business, or family reasons.

Latvia imposed entry restrictions on Russian citizens in September 2022 as part of a joint agreement with Lithuania, Estonia, and Poland. Czechia implemented similar restrictions in October 2022.

Concerns over the abuse of Schengen visas and diplomatic privileges have grown amid a wave of suspected Russian sabotage and espionage on EU soil.

On April 15, Polish media outlet Rzeczpospolita reported that Poland and Czechia are leading a new effort to restrict the movement of Russian diplomats within the Schengen zone.

The initiative, reportedly first proposed in Prague in late 2023, targets individuals alleged to be operating under diplomatic cover while serving Russian military intelligence (GRU) and other security services.

Editor's note: This story has been updated to include confirmation from the Dutch Defense Ministry.

The Netherlands will send the remainder of the 24 F-16 fighter jets it had promised to Ukraine on May 26, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said on the Dutch broadcaster WNL on May 25.

Ukraine received its first F-16 jets from the Netherlands and Denmark in 2024. The U.S.-made fourth-generation fighter jets have been deployed to bolster Ukraine's sky shield and help repel Russian aerial attacks.

""We are also training pilots and technicians and sharing our military doctrines, so that Ukraine can build a modern armed force that matches that of the NATO member states,"" Brekelmans said on air.

Later in the day, the Dutch Defense Ministry confirmed the shipment of the final batch of 24 F-16 fighter jets bound for Ukraine.

According to a statement on the ministry's official website, ""The aircraft left Volkel Air Base today for Belgium, where they are being prepared for delivery (to Ukraine).""

Apart from the Dutch aircraft, Ukraine has been promised 19 F-16s by Denmark, 30 by Belgium, and at least six from Norway. European nations have agreed to supply aircraft to help modernize the Ukrainian Air Force as they themselves transition to more advanced F-35 fighter jets.

The F-16 aircraft are being provided within the framework of the international fighter jet coalition, with some partners contributing training and technical support.

Oslo announced earlier this month that it would complete the delivery of its planes by the end of 2025. Similarly, the Belgian government said it would provide its aircraft sooner than the 2028 deadline.

The head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, Kirill Dmitriev, is spearheading efforts to secure the release of some $280 billion in frozen Russian assets, Ukrainian Foreign Intelligence Service (SZRU) Chief Oleh Ivashchenko told Ukrinform in an interview published on May 26.

Kyiv-born Dmitriev was previously appointed by President Vladimir Putin as a special envoy for economic affairs, tasked with facilitating dialogue with the Trump administration.

""Dmitriev's main task is to get Russia's frozen assets out. This is a colossal amount for them,"" Ivashchenko said.

Western governments froze around $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Kyiv has repeatedly urged the G7 and EU to move from freezing to confiscating those funds and using them to finance Ukraine's defense and post-war recovery. Western governments have primarily relied on reallocating interest income generated by the frozen funds to support Kyiv.

Ivashchenko accused Dmitriev of trying to reframe the international conversation away from Russia's war against Ukraine.

""Dmitriev is trying to show the U.S. that let's not focus on war and peace, let's look at the bigger picture. We have the Arctic, we have oil, gas, we have Siberia with resources,"" he said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking on April 9, also said that Dmitriev has been tasked with conveying Moscow's economic proposals to Washington. Dmitriev previously played a key role in Russia's backchannel diplomacy with the Trump team after the 2016 U.S. election.

After his May 19 call with Putin, U.S. President Donald Trump said Russia was ready to engage in major trade deals with the U.S. once the war ends.

""There is a tremendous opportunity for Russia to create massive amounts of jobs and wealth,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post. ""Its potential is unlimited. Likewise, Ukraine can be a great beneficiary on trade, in the process of rebuilding its country.""

Ivashchenko warned that these overtures from Dmitriev are part of a deliberate effort to deflect attention from Ukraine and gain leverage in broader geopolitical negotiations.

""The issue of Ukraine is being blurred,"" he added.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/04/GettyImages-1148451166.jpg

U.S. President Donald Trump has come to understand that Russian President Vladimir Putin misled him about being ready for peace with Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron said on May 26, according to the French TV channel BFM.

""I think President Trump realizes that when President Putin told him he was ready for peace, he lied to him,"" Macron said during a visit to Hanoi. ""What's happening in Ukraine is unacceptable and extremely serious. You can't say you're ready to talk and then bomb.""

Russia launched a three-day wave of aerial attacks from May 24 to May 26, firing more than 600 drones and dozens of missiles across Ukraine.

Ukraine's Air Force said Russia launched nine Kh-101 cruise missiles from Tu-95MS bombers and a record 355 Shahed-type drones and decoys overnight on May 26.

Trump, who has repeatedly pressed for a ceasefire and held a two-hour phone call with Putin on May 19, expressed strong disapproval of the latest escalation.

""I'm not happy with Putin,"" he told reporters on May 25, adding on Truth Social that the Russian president has gone ""absolutely"" crazy.

""I've always said that he wants all of Ukraine, not just a piece of it, and maybe that's proving to be right,"" Trump wrote. ""But if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia!""

Despite acknowledging Putin's escalatory behavior, Trump also criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky, with whom he has had a strained relationship.

Zelensky on May 25 condemned the U.S. for its lack of response to the massive Russian assault, calling for stronger sanctions and saying that ""America's silence... only encourages Putin.""

""Likewise, President Zelensky is doing his country no favors by talking the way he does,"" Trump posted. ""Everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don't like it, and it better stop.""

Macron said the latest bombardments were further evidence that Moscow is not negotiating in good faith. ""This doublespeak shows the inauthentic nature of the discussions that may have taken place,"" he said.

The U.S. president's approach to negotiations frustrates European allies, many of whom sought his support for a joint U.S.–EU ultimatum demanding an unconditional ceasefire starting May 12 and tougher sanctions on Moscow.

In Washington, Republican lawmakers have echoed the call for punitive actions against Moscow. U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg told Fox Business that the ""Russian Sanctions Act of 2025 is ready to go.""

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on May 1 that the legislation includes sweeping financial penalties and 500% tariffs on countries that continue buying Russian oil, gas, or uranium.

Kellogg reacted to Russia's overnight large-scale attack on Ukraine on May 25, calling for an end to hostilities.

""The indiscriminate killing of women and children at night in their homes is a clear violation of the 1977 Geneva Peace Protocols designed to protect innocents. These attacks are shameful,"" Kellogg wrote on X without explicitly naming Russia.

The Kyiv Independent has no one single owner, but instead receives the majority of its funding from readers who pledge to contribute financially on a monthly or yearly basis. Other sources of funding include one-time donations, our online store, content syndication, and advertising. In this way, we can ensure that we serve our readers and community, and nobody else.

Our readers who provide recurring financial support are called members of the Kyiv Independent. Most of our members give $5 a month — and thanks to their contributions, we are able to fund our operations and reach millions of readers around the world every week. Membership shows just how powerful collective action can be.

Why did the Kyiv Independent decide to be funded by its members?

The reason for this funding model lies in the history of the company — the Kyiv Independent was born out of a fight for freedom of speech, and for that reason, a founding principle was that no single owner could control the publication.

The Kyiv Independent was co-founded by a group of journalists in November 2021 who had been fired from the Kyiv Post, the biggest English-language newspaper in Ukraine at the time, as the owner attempted to take the newsroom under control and end its independent coverage.

When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, tens of thousands of people decided to support our journalism, both by donating and becoming members. This gave us the financial stability to scale our work and set us on the path to becoming the largest English-language media outlet from Ukraine.

We still rely on our readers to fund our journalism, because it keeps us truly independent — we’re only accountable to the community we serve.

What is a membership model, exactly?

In short, membership is a way to fund journalism that places readers at the center. Members give a recurring contribution every month, and in return, they receive membership benefits and additional ways to get involved in a cause they believe in.

By the end of 2024, the Kyiv Independent’s community was around 14,000 members, which accounted for 70% of our entire revenue. At the time of publishing this article in May 2025, our community has grown to over 17,500 members.

Membership goes beyond a subscription in that it’s more than just a monetary transaction. It’s essentially a social contract between those who produce the news and the communities who rely on it.

A breakdown of the Kyiv Independent's funding in 2024. Our readers accounted for providing 70% of our revenue, the majority of which came from recurring memberships.

What benefits do members get?

Membership benefits refer to the exclusive offerings available to our members. These benefits not only allow us to express our gratitude to those who support our journalism, but also mean we can learn from those who care about our reporting, giving our members a way to get more involved in a cause they believe in.

This model lets our members connect with our team, provide feedback, and share ideas. At the Kyiv Independent, some of our membership benefits are Q&As with our journalists, ad-free reading on the Kyiv Independent website, and a discount to our online store.

We also grant you access to our community Discord server: An exclusive space we set up so our members can discuss current events, share resources on how to get involved to help Ukraine more, provide feedback on our website and journalism, and even share memes.

Host Anna Belokur fields questions for the next episode of “Ukraine This Week” in our community Discord server on April 9, 2025. One of our membership benefits is the ability to ask Anna questions for the chance to be featured at the end of our weekly video show.

One of our most popular benefits is a letter we send our members every Friday, which shows you what we accomplished in the last week, highlighting our top stories and giving you behind-the-scenes updates of our office.

Membership benefits are optional to engage with — members don’t have to use their benefits — but the option is always there. You can read more about our membership benefits here.

Why do we prioritize memberships over one-time donations?

Sustainable revenue means truly independent journalism. Recurring contributions, rather than one-time donations, mean that we can better plan for the future because we have an accurate idea of what our revenue will look like. With stable funding, we know that we can cover any topic or voice our true opinions without fear that our budget might be affected by those in power.

If I become a member, what difference do I make?

Quite simply, we wouldn't be here without our members. It’s the thousands of people from around the world who have chosen to support our work who’ve made it possible for us to build a media company — showing the world the truth about Russia’s full-scale invasion.

Journalism isn’t free, so it’s our members who allow us to pay the salaries of journalists who bring you the news, fund reporting trips to the front lines, and help finance the production of our documentaries investigating Russian war crimes.

Our reader revenue model means we don’t have to rely on any government funding, including foreign grants — which can be unreliable sources of revenue, as they can be directly and immediately affected by the policy of new administrations. The freeze on USAID severely impacted other independent media outlets in Ukraine earlier this year — but thanks to our members, we were insulated from this extreme policy change.

It’s also thanks to our members that we don’t have a paywall on our articles. All of our journalism is free and accessible to everyone, because a core part of our mission is to act as a bridge between Ukraine and the world. Especially during war, access to accurate and reliable information is critical — and this shouldn’t be affected by someone’s socioeconomic status.

In the words of the Kyiv Independent’s CEO Daryna Shevchenko, “We want to ensure reliable information from Ukraine reaches as many people as possible, regardless of their ability, or even willingness to pay for it.”

“We need to ensure that as many decision-makers, political and state actors, and active society members in different countries are exposed to truthful information about what is happening in Ukraine now, regardless of their views, values, or political stance.”

“We want to make sure that no one out there would be able to say — ‘we did not know.’”

Ukrainian media company Vector is behind what it says is a global first in digital journalism: letting readers start listening to an article from any point, the company announced in a press release on May 26.

Vector, a media platform focused on the creative economy, launched the new artificial intelligence-powered narration tool in partnership with Respeecher, the Ukrainian voice technology startup known for recreating the voices of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader in major Hollywood productions.

The tool allows users to click on any sentence in an article — not only the beginning — on Vector’s website and immediately hear it read aloud in a natural-sounding voice. It is designed to make content more accessible, especially for people with visual impairments or for those who prefer audio over reading.

""Our goal was to change the paradigm of content consumption not only in Ukraine but globally,"" said Ismail Osbanov, CEO of Vector.

""Imagine you're reading an article at home and realize you need to leave for errands. Instead of stopping and forgetting about it, you can continue listening in the car.""

Thanks to Respeecher's advanced text-to-speech models, users can hear the articles in the voices of well-known Ukrainian figures like businessman Garik Korogodsky, musician Positiff, and entrepreneur Artem Borodatiuk, the press release said.

Respeecher's CTO Dmytro Bielievtsov says this collaboration is a natural evolution of their work.

""In film, we typically use speech-to-speech technology, where a live actor performs with the voice of another.

President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to arrive in Berlin on May 28 for a surprise visit and a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Der Spiegel reported on May 26, citing undisclosed government sources.

The meeting comes as Merz seeks to promote European efforts to initiate further technical-level peace talks between Ukraine and Russia.

According to Der Spiegel, Merz plans to discuss potential steps toward facilitating such negotiations directly with Zelensky. He will also brief the Ukrainian leader on plans for a new European Union sanctions package targeting Russia, aimed at increasing pressure on Moscow to engage in serious dialogue.

Ahead of the May 16 peace talks in Istanbul, Merz had warned the Kremlin of sweeping new sanctions if Russian President Vladimir Putin continued to obstruct progress. The Istanbul talks — the first in three years — ended after less than two hours, with no agreement on a ceasefire.

The only significant outcome was a deal to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war on each side.

Moscow repeated its maximalist demands, including a full Ukrainian withdrawal from four partially occupied regions it claims to have annexed — a position Kyiv and its allies reject.

Ukrainian officials described the talks as brief and unproductive, saying that Russian negotiators lacked real authority. Despite Merz's earlier threat, no new sanctions have been announced in the wake of the failed negotiations.

During his May 28 visit, Zelensky is also scheduled to meet with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

The visit, reportedly organized at short notice, is intended to demonstrate unified European resolve in pursuing a diplomatic track while maintaining robust military and political support for Ukraine.

Zelensky's trip to Berlin comes around three weeks after a high-profile meeting in Kyiv on May 10, when French President Emmanuel Macron, Merz, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk visited the Ukrainian capital for joint talks.

The meeting marked Merz's first visit to Ukraine as chancellor and the first time all four leaders stood together in Kyiv.

In a joint statement issued by the U.K. government before the trip, the leaders pledged solidarity with Ukraine against ""Russia's barbaric and illegal full-scale invasion."" They expressed support for U.S. President Donald Trump's calls for a peace deal and urged Russia to stop obstructing efforts toward a lasting ceasefire.

LATEST: Decision on lifting range restrictions on arms for Ukraine made months ago, Germany's Merz clarifies.

Western partners are not imposing any range restrictions on weapons delivered to Ukraine for use against Russian military targets, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on May 26.

""There are no longer any restrictions on the range of weapons delivered to Ukraine – neither by the U.K., France, nor us. There are no restrictions by the U.S. either,"" Merz said during a discussion forum organized by the WDR channel.

""This means that Ukraine can now defend itself, for example, by attacking military positions in Russia,"" the chancellor added. ""Until recently, it couldn’t do that, and apart from very few exceptions, it hadn’t done so either.""

Ukraine has previously received long-range missiles from the U.S., the U.K., and France — including ATACMS, Storm Shadow, and SCALP — but was initially permitted to deploy them only against Russian military forces in occupied Ukrainian territories.

Only in late 2024, the U.S. Biden administration and other allies eased the restrictions, allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles against Russian military targets in border regions. U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized ex-President Joe Biden's decision to ease the restrictions as he seeks to negotiate a peace agreement between Kyiv and Moscow.

The German chancellor also stressed that while Ukraine is using its arms to target Russian military infrastructure, Russia continues to attack Ukrainian ""cities, kindergartens, hospitals, and care homes.""

Before becoming chancellor, Merz signaled he would overturn the ban of his predecessor, Olaf Scholz, on the delivery of Germany's Taurus cruise missiles, capable of striking targets at a distance of 500 kilometers (300 miles). He has not confirmed whether he intends to deliver the missiles since taking office.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2213769154.jpg

Ukraine could not influence who Russia decided to release in the recent 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange, said Andrii Yusov, deputy head of the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (POW), in comments for Suspilne published on May 26.

The statement came in reaction to claims that Anatolii Taranenko, a Ukrainian service member accused of collaborating with Russia, was released by Moscow during the second phase of the prisoner exchange on May 24. Multiple media outlets recorded a man resembling Taranenko during the swap.

Taranenko surrendered to Russian proxy forces in Donetsk Oblast in 2021 and was accused of seeking to defect to Russia's side and harm his fellow Ukrainian soldiers. He then appeared in the Russian media in what was described as staged propaganda stunts.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims, and Ukrainian officials have not confirmed the accusations.

Ukrainian investigators are working to identify Taranenko and verify the accusations, Yusov told Suspilne, adding that ""law enforcement agencies will take an appropriate response"" if the claims are confirmed.

Taranenko's alleged inclusion in the exchange exacerbated criticism that Ukraine failed to secure the release of any Azov fighters and many civilians who had been held captive by Russia for years in what was the largest prisoner swap of the full-scale war.

The Russian media reported that a man named ""Anatolii Taranenko"" was released in the exchange, while Ukraine has not published the official lists.

""We could not influence the list. Russia handed over who it was ready to hand over, and Ukraine as well,"" Yusov explained, adding that the exchange was arranged in a short time frame.

The swap was the only tangible result of the Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul on May 16, the first such negotiations in three years. The exchange, which mostly included military captives, was carried out in three phases between May 23 and 25.

Kyiv and Moscow have previously held a number of prisoner exchanges during the full-scale war, which were more limited in scope and mediated by third-party countries.

""Ukraine is fighting for every one of its citizens. We are working under extremely difficult conditions amid the full-scale invasion, and the Mariupol garrison remains one of the top priorities for repatriation,"" Yusov said last week.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/headquarters-pow.jpg

Belarus possesses nuclear weapon delivery systems but no warheads, Ukrainian foreign intelligence (SZRU) chief Oleh Ivashchenko said in an interview with Ukrinform published on May 26.

Belarus has been a key ally to Moscow and has previously been reported as hosting Russian tactical nuclear arms on its territory, after the two countries signed an agreement in May 2023.

Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko said in December of the same year that the transfer of Russian nuclear weapons to Belarus was completed in early October.

But according to Ivashchenko, at the present time Belarus does not possess any nuclear weapons.

""There are no warheads. They are setting up storage facilities, preparing, and building. Lukashenko says they will have Oreshnik by the end of the year. But this looks like wishful thinking. As of today, there is nothing like that, and it is unlikely that it will happen,"" Ivashchenko said.

Russia and Belarus have deepened nuclear cooperation since the start of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

They held the second stage of tactical weapons nuclear drills, amid escalating tensions between Moscow and the West, the Kremlin's Defense Ministry said in June, 2024.

The first stage of the exercises, which were ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 6, 2024, involved missile units in Russia's Southern Military District, including the occupied territories of Ukraine.

Nicusor Dan was sworn in as Romania's president on May 26 in a formal ceremony before Parliament, pledging to be ""a president open to the voice of society,"" Romanian news outlet Digi24 reported.

Pro-EU centrist and then-Bucharest Mayor Dan won the Romanian presidential election on May 18, defeating the far-right, anti-Ukraine George Simion with 53.6% of the votes.

During the ceremony, Dan took the constitutional oath with his hand on the Bible and the Constitution, vowing to serve the Romanian people and uphold the rule of law.

In his address to lawmakers following the oath, Dan thanked citizens for their engagement in recent political debates, regardless of their stance.

""Society has shown that it is alive and strong,"" Dan said, adding: ""I invite you to continue your civic involvement and apply pressure on the Romanian state to reform.""

Dan's inauguration marks the end of the interim term of Ilie Bolojan, who had served as Romania's acting president since the resignation of President Klaus Iohannis in February.

The inauguration was blessed by Patriarch Daniel, head of the Romanian Orthodox Church. Marian Enache, president of the Constitutional Court, confirmed the legitimacy of Dan's mandate, urging him to be ""the president of all Romanians,"" including those who did not vote for him.

Simion, head of the far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians who has been banned from entering Ukraine, decided to contest his loss, filing an appeal to annul the election results with Romania's Constitutional Court. The court unanimously rejected the appeal as ""unfounded.""

The election took place against the backdrop of Romania's previous presidential vote in November 2024, which was annulled after credible evidence of foreign interference, including pro-Russian disinformation efforts. That first round of the annulled election was won by ultranationalist Calin Georgescu, known for promoting conspiracy theories and questioning Ukraine's sovereignty.

Dan's victory is seen as a positive signal for Romania's continued pro-Ukraine and pro-European direction. President Volodymyr Zelensky has already extended an invitation for Dan to visit Kyiv for high-level talks.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2212852694.jpg

Russia appears to be newly using Telegram messaging app bots to control its attack drones, ensuring real-time flight data and footage feed for human operators, the Economist reported on May 25, citing Ukrainian engineers.

The new control algorithm was revealed in a note hidden inside one of the Russian drones, possibly left behind by a ""sympathetic Russian engineer,"" the Economist wrote.

Russia has been ramping up its drone production to launch ever-greater strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. The night of May 26 marked the most extensive drone attack of the full-scale war, reportedly involving 355 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys.

The new control methods, relying on artificial intelligence and Ukraine's own internet networks, present a challenge to Ukrainian defenses as they make Russian drones more resistant to GPS jamming, the Economist reported.

The latest Shahed models also appear to be using jet engines and Starlink satellite attachments, the Kyiv Independent reported earlier this month.

Speaking to the Economist, Ukrainian aviation expert Kostiantyn Kryvolap cast doubt on Russia's reported plans to launch 1,000 drones per day, but acknowledged that Moscow's production capabilities will ""increase significantly.""

Russia has been deploying Iranian-made Shaheds and their domestically-produced copies, Gerans, to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses in massive swarm attacks, allowing more destructive ballistic and cruise missiles to slip through.

Moscow's forces appear to be using already the sixth modification of the Shahed drones, using machine learning to strike their targets, according to the Economist. Nevertheless, Ukrainian air defenses are still capable of intercepting 95% of the drones Russia launches, a senior Ukrainian official told the outlet.

Ukraine's sky shield is increasingly stretched thin as Western air defense supplies are running out. An undisclosed source told Le Monde that Ukraine has run out of ammunition for its two SAMP/T air defense batteries, while the Crotale short-range anti-aircraft systems have not received new missiles for a year and a half.

It remains unclear how many U.S.-designed Patriot interceptors, which are key in intercepting Russian ballistic missiles, are left in Ukraine's stockpiles, as the Trump administration is yet to approve any new military aid packages.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said earlier this month that the U.S. is working with NATO partners to locate additional Patriot air defense systems for Ukraine.

In an April 13 interview with CBS News, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine is ready to buy 10 U.S.-made Patriot systems for $15 billion. Despite Kyiv's appeals, U.S. President Donald Trump dismissed the request, accusing Zelensky of ""always looking to purchase missiles"" and falsely blaming Ukraine for provoking the war.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2201968150.jpg

Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said on May 25 he wants President Volodymyr Zelensky to attend the NATO summit in The Hague next month, Dutch daily NRC reported.

Italy's ANSA news agency reported earlier this month that the United States opposed Zelensky's participation, citing unnamed diplomatic sources. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio denied the claims.

""We are looking at how we can get a place in the program for Zelensky and other Ukrainians,"" Brekelmans said during an appearance on the Dutch television program WNL op Zondag, according to NRC.

""As far as the Netherlands is concerned, Zelensky is welcome at every meeting.""

While it remains unclear whether Zelensky would be allowed to address the full plenary session with all 32 NATO allies, Brekelmans did not rule out alternative formats.

""It can also be in another form. Whether that will be in a session with (U.S. President Donald) Trump, I don't know,"" he added.

At the previous NATO summit in Washington in 2024, Zelensky was a prominent presence, engaging directly with allied leaders. This year, the tone appears more cautious as NATO members weigh how to handle Ukraine's future in the alliance amid renewed questions about U.S. commitment.

Trump has claimed that Ukraine provoked the war by pursuing NATO membership, a narrative often used by Russian propaganda to justify its 2022 full-scale invasion.

The June 24-25 summit in The Hague will be the first one led by NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. According to NATO officials who spoke with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Rutte will need to navigate a delicate political landscape and manage Trump's expectations.

NATO allies are also likely to announce a new collective commitment to boost defense expenditures to 5% of GDP – a dramatic leap from the current 2% target. Of that, 3.5% would go to weapons and artillery, with 1.5% allocated for cybersecurity and military infrastructure, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

To minimize internal disagreements, the summit has reportedly been shortened from three days to two. Discussions are expected to focus on defense spending and strengthening the defense industrial base.

Notably, this year's communique may omit direct mention of both Russia and Ukraine — a contrast to past summits where Ukraine dominated the agenda. One NATO official told RFE/RL that referencing Ukraine at all could open the door to internal disputes and a watered-down message.

In 2024, the Alliance adopted the Ukraine Compact, a long-term security framework signed by all 32 NATO members. The compact, which was built upon the 2023 G7 declaration in Vilnius, outlines commitments to train Ukrainian forces, provide military and economic aid, and respond collectively in the event of renewed Russian aggression.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160755613--1-.jpg

Russia is not winning the war in Ukraine, European Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius said in an interview with LRT broadcaster published on May 26, stressing Europe must stop relying on the United States to ensure that remains the case.

In the interview, Kubilius said the EU must be ready to defend Ukraine and itself with or without Washington's backing.

While U.S. support has been vital, Kubilius said that the EU's long-term security depends on its own strategic and industrial strength, especially as U.S. President Donald Trump has signaled he may walk away from peace efforts unless progress is made.

""450 million Europeans should not be begging 340 million Americans to protect Europe from 140 million Russians who cannot take on 38 million Ukrainians,"" Kubilius said.

Kubilius said Europe has matched the U.S. in aid to Ukraine — around 60 billion euros ($68 billion) over the last three years, including the U.K. and Norway — yet still hesitates to take full ownership of the war's outcome.

Recent findings from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy also reported that total assistance — military and civilian — allocated by Europe to Ukraine since 2022 actually exceeds that of the U.S. by 23 billion euros ($26 billion).

""The annual support is about 20 billion euros ($23 billion) each. Twenty billion on the European side and 20 billion on the American side is less than 0.1% of GDP for both,"" Kubilius noted. ""We are spending 3% or 3.5% on our own defense, and we are spending less than 0.1% on the defense of Ukraine.""

Europe must prepare for a world in which U.S. involvement in its defense wanes, Kubilius argued. While he emphasized the importance of avoiding a ""chaotic divorce"" with Washington, he said the EU must develop a clear and independent defense policy.

""It is far worse to be unprepared or to go into an angry and chaotic divorce with the Americans,"" he said. ""It is better for us to come up with a clear plan of what we want from the Americans over the next decade, avoid chaos, than to be constantly begging them to stay and be completely unprepared and then face a full-scale crisis.”

Kubilius said this included developing the EU's own defense industry.

""Up to now, when Europeans were buying weapons, only 20% of their purchases were coming from European industry, while over 65% were coming from the U.S.,"" Kubilius noted.

Asked whether the EU has a plan if the U.S. withdraws support for Ukraine, Kubilius said Europe is not helpless. According to him, a 150-billion-euro ($170 billion) EU loan facility could provide new channels to strengthen Ukraine's military capabilities and defense sector — if member states are willing to act.

""Yes, Ukraine needs support. Yes, that support can come from the European Union together with America. Without America, too, we need to think about how we are going to do it,"" he said. ""There is no other way.""

Editor's note: The article was updated with the Air Force's report.

Russia launched its third large-scale aerial and drone assault against Ukraine in three nights, killing at least six people and injuring 24 across multiple oblasts over the past 24 hours, regional authorities reported on May 26.

Moscow's forces launched nine Kh-101 cruise missiles from Tu-95MS bomber planes and a record number of 355 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys overnight, Ukraine's Air Force reported.

Ukrainian air defenses shot down all nine missiles and 233 drones, and 55 Russian drones were neutralized by electronic warfare systems or disappeared from radars, according to the statement.

The attack marked the most extensive drone strike against Ukraine during the full-scale war, topping the previous record of 298 drones overnight on May 25.

In Kharkiv Oblast, two people were killed in Kupiansk as Russian forces launched a wide-ranging barrage involving glide bombs, various drone types, and artillery. Three other civilians were injured, according to Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov.

Russian strikes damaged 39 houses, a business, a car repair shop, a store, and two vehicles in the Kupiansk district. Other infrastructure, including power lines in the Bohodukhiv district and a civilian enterprise in the Kharkiv district, was also hit.

In Donetsk Oblast, six civilians were injured in Russian attacks across the region, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin.

In Kherson Oblast, one person was killed and four others wounded as Russian forces shelled and launched drone attacks on at least 30 settlements, including the city of Kherson.

The strikes damaged two apartment buildings, 11 houses, a gas pipeline, a cellphone tower, and several vehicles. Social infrastructure sites were also targeted, the governor said.

In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, two civilians were injured after Russian forces launched 419 attacks across 12 settlements, including 26 air strikes and over 250 drone strikes. Authorities reported damage to houses, cars, and civilian infrastructure in multiple towns.

In Odesa Oblast, a 14-year-old teenager was injured in the village of Velykodolynske after a Russian drone strike. In the Odesa district, a 100-square-meter residential building was destroyed, and several more buildings, garages, and vehicles were damaged or destroyed, the governor said.

In Kyiv Oblast, Russia launched another combined missile and drone attack overnight, local authorities said. No injuries were reported, but explosions damaged three houses and several utility buildings in the Boryspil district, one house in the Fastiv district, and a car in the Bucha district. Air defenses intercepted several incoming threats, and no critical infrastructure facility was hit.

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian forces targeted Nikopol and surrounding communities with Grad rockets, artillery, and drones, damaging both residential buildings and vehicles. In the Synelnykove district, two houses were struck by an FPV drone. No casualties were reported.

In Khmelnytskyi Oblast, Russian forces launched a second consecutive night of combined attacks on the region, Governor Serhii Tiurin said. No injuries were reported, but several houses and businesses were damaged.

In Mykolaiv Oblast, two civilians were killed and six others injured during a massive drone attack on the city of Mykolaiv, Governor Vitalii Kim said. Three of the injured were hospitalized and are in serious condition. In separate incidents, FPV drones targeted the Kutsurub and Ochakiv communities overnight. No further casualties were reported in those areas.

In Sumy Oblast, one person was killed and two others injured in separate drone and artillery attacks across the region, local authorities said. Russian forces launched 80 attacks on 33 settlements using glide bombs, rocket artillery, and FPV drones. Houses and infrastructure were damaged in the communities of Khotin and Romny.

In Cherkasy Oblast, air defenses shot down 25 drones over the region overnight. No casualties were reported, although blast waves from earlier strikes damaged windows and infrastructure in Uman.

In response to the Russian strikes, Poland once again scrambled military aircraft overnight. This marks the second consecutive night that Polish air defenses have been placed on high alert due to activity by Russia’s long-range aviation, according to the Polish Armed Forces.

Russia will be able to restore its combat capabilities and launch an aggression against Europe between two and four years after hostilities in Ukraine end, Ukrainian foreign intelligence (SZRU) chief Oleh Ivashchenko said in an interview with Ukrinform published on May 26.

""If the sanctions are lifted, the rearmament process will proceed much faster,"" Ivashchenko said in the interview, adding that Kyiv has shared its estimates with European partners.

Western officials have previously shared similar time estimates, underscoring the growing threat of an open clash between Moscow and NATO after the Russian full-scale war against Ukraine ends.

Russia's military is currently heavily engaged in Ukraine, suffering massive losses in manpower and equipment. Christopher Cavoli, commander of U.S. forces in Europe, nevertheless warned in April that Russia is rebuilding its forces much faster than previously anticipated.

Ukraine's military claims that Russia has suffered close to 1 million men killed, injured, or otherwise listed as casualties since the outbreak of the full-scale war.

Kyiv's Western partners — namely the U.S. and the EU — have also sought to restrain Russia's ability to reconstitute its forces by imposing heavy sanctions aimed at cutting off supply chains and throttling Moscow's economy.

U.S., European, and Ukrainian officials and military experts believe that Russia is losing its military edge on the battlefield, presenting it as an impetus to increase pressure on Moscow and force it toward a ceasefire, the Washington Post reported.

Instead, U.S. President Donald Trump said he does not plan any additional sanctions against Russia, so as not to disrupt peace efforts, dashing European hopes of a coordinated strategy. The EU has pledged to ramp up sanctions if Russia continues to reject a ceasefire, and the bloc's 18th sanctions package is currently under discussion.

Russian air defenses opened fire against drones near the Yelabuga drone production site in Russia's Tatarstan Republic, while other drones attacked a chemical plant in Ivanovo Oblast, independent news channel Astra reported on May 26.

The reported attacks against Russian industrial facilities come as Moscow intensifies its aerial strikes against Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv.

Local residents reported air defense fire and drones flying over Yelabuga city on May 25, Astra and Baza Telegram channels wrote. The so-called Alabuga Special Economic Zone hosts a factory producing Shahed-type drones and has been repeatedly targeted by Ukrainian forces throughout the full-scale war.

It is unclear whether the facility, lying some 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border, suffered any damage in the May 25 attack.

The drones targeted the town's Dmitrievsky Chemical Plant, Astra reported, citing residents. The facility produces components for Russian arms, namely missiles, Ukrainian official Andrii Kovalenko said.

Kineshma lies around 750 kilometers (470 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border.

At least 10 explosions were also reported in Russia's Tula Oblast overnight. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed its forces had downed 148 Ukrainian drones between 10 a.m. local time on May 25 and 8 a.m. on May 26.

Ukrainian forces captured 971 Russian soldiers during a months-long offensive in Russia’s Kursk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on May 25, describing the campaign as key to conducting prisoner exchanges.

The announcement came a day after Ukraine brought home 303 prisoners of war in the final phase of a 1,000-for-1,000 exchange with Russia. The swap was agreed during peace talks held in Turkey on May 16, the first direct negotiations between the two countries in three years.

According to the General Staff, the 971 Russian troops were taken captive between Aug. 6, 2024, and May 25, 2025, as part of Ukraine's ongoing offensive in Kursk Oblast. The military described the campaign as an ""unexpected and asymmetric"" move that helped fill the so-called ""exchange fund"" — Ukrainian terminology for captured Russian soldiers who can be traded for Ukrainian POWs.

Critics had previously questioned the strategic value of the Kursk operation, citing high costs and unclear gains.

""Only unconventional decisions can defeat a numerically superior enemy,"" the statement read. ""The Kursk campaign has proven to be exactly that — its success recognized around the world.""

The May 25 prisoner release brought home soldiers from the Armed Forces, National Guard, Border Guard Service, and Special Transport Service. Families and comrades welcomed the returnees, including 70 troops who had defended Mariupol during the 2022 siege of the port city.

President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the negotiation team on social media, saying, ""We will bring back every single one of our people from Russian captivity.""

The recent exchange was carried out in three phases over three days and remains the only tangible outcome of the Turkish-hosted talks. While Kyiv continues to advocate for an ""all-for-all"" prisoner swap, Moscow has so far rejected the proposal.

Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly recently visited Kursk Oblast, which was Putin's first known visit to the region since Moscow declared on April 26 that it had completed a military operation to liberate the territory from Ukrainian forces.

President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on May 25 that three new sanction packages have officially taken effect, following their approval by Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council.

In a Facebook post, Zelensky outlined the scope of the latest measures, which aim to penalize Russian individuals and networks supporting the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine.

The first package targets individuals involved in financing terrorism, financial fraud, and sanctions evasion schemes that benefit Russia. The second focuses on ""propagandists whose lies fuel Russia’s attacks on Ukraine,"" according to Zelensky. A third package applies to members of Russian criminal organizations that support President Vladimir Putin’s regime and have established close ties with it.

Zelensky underscored that these actions are part of Ukraine’s broader strategy to align with international partners. ""Ukraine continues to coordinate its sanction decisions with the sanction regimes of the European Union and other key global jurisdictions,"" the president said.

In addition to announcing the new packages, Zelensky enacted a separate decree sanctioning several individuals. These include Oleksandr Bohuslayev, son of Motor Sich's former president Vyacheslav Bohuslayev, former Member of Parliament Ihor Mosiychuk, and the owner of the Russian online casino Pin-Up.

Bohuslayev was recently detained in Monaco on fraud charges linked to a $650 million asset scheme, according to Ukraine's Security Service (SBU). Vyacheslav Bohuslayev, the former president of Motor Sich, Ukraine's leading aircraft engine manufacturer, is kept in custody since 2022 on charges of collaboration with Russia.

Mosiychuk has publicly blamed Ukraine's leadership for the Russian invasion, claiming the war could have been prevented through diplomacy.

Germany’s Chief of Defense, Carsten Breuer, has issued a directive ordering the German military to be fully equipped with weapons and materials by 2029, citing concerns that Russia could be capable of attacking NATO territory by then.

The internal document seen by Reuters, titled ""Directive Priorities for the Bolstering of Readiness"" and signed on May 19, outlines a detailed roadmap to prepare Germany’s armed forces over the next five years.

The directive reflects shared assessments by Breuer and NATO officials that Russia may have rebuilt its military enough to pose a direct threat to the alliance’s borders. Funding for the plan will come from the loosening of Germany’s ""debt brake"" in March, which allows additional defense spending.

The document sets acquisition priorities that align with NATO’s recommendations. Chief among them is strengthening Germany’s air defenses, with particular emphasis on countering drones. NATO is expected to ask Berlin to at least quadruple its air defense systems, ranging from long-range platforms such as the Patriot to short-range interceptors.

In addition to bolstering aerial defenses, the directive calls for capabilities to conduct deep precision strikes against targets more than 500 kilometers away. Breuer also emphasized the urgency of replenishing Germany’s ammunition stockpiles and increasing stockpiling targets across all ammunition types.

""He's killing a lot of people,"" Trump said to reporters at an airport in New Jersey before returning to Washington on May 25. ""I don't know what the hell happened to Putin, I've known him for a long time...""

Trump's comments followed Russia’s massive air assault on Ukraine over the weekend, during which more than 600 drones and dozens of missiles were launched from Friday to Sunday in one of the heaviest attacks of the war to date.

At least 12 people were killed, including three children, and 79 injured in strikes that targeted numerous cities including Kyiv overnight on May 25. The Russian forces attacked the city of Kyiv, as well as Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytsky, Ternopil, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Sumy, Poltava regions. More than 80 residential buildings have been damaged.

Trump, who has pushed for a ceasefire in the war now in its fourth year, recently held a two-hour phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin during which Russia reiterated its refusal for a full ceasefire in the war in Ukraine while the U.S. failed to respond with any significant pressure.

Speaking to reporters on May 25, Trump once again said that new sanctions on Moscow could be on the table. ""I’ve always gotten along with him,"" Trump said of Putin. ""But he’s sending rockets into cities and killing people (...) We're in the middle of talking and he's shooting rockets into Kyiv and other cities. I don't like it at all.""

In a new Truth Social post later that day, Trump said Putin has gone ""absolutely"" crazy and warned that if he didn’t stop his actions, it could bring about the collapse of Russia.

""I’ve always said that he wants ALL of Ukraine, not just a piece of it, and maybe that’s proving to be right, but if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia!""

Trump then shifted his attention to President Volodymyr Zelensky, whom he has frequently criticized. Zelensky had earlier condemned the lack of response from the U.S. and other nations following Russia’s latest missile and drone assault. Zelensky called for stronger sanctions on Russia and added that ""America’s silence, and the silence of others around the world, only encourages Putin.""

""Likewise, President Zelensky is doing his Country no favors by talking the way he does,"" Trump wrote. ""Everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don’t like it, and it better stop.""

Earlier in the day, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg reacted to Russia's overnight large-scale attack on Ukraine on May 25, calling for the end to hostilities.

""The indiscriminate killing of women and children at night in their homes is a clear violation of the 1977 Geneva Peace Protocols designed to protect innocents. These attacks are shameful,"" Kellogg said on X without explicitly naming Russia. ""Stop the killing. Ceasefire now.""

Meanwhile, Republican Don Bacon said ""peace talks are having zero effect on Putin.""

""His goal is to dominate Ukraine & he won’t stop until he realizes he cannot win,"" Bacon wrote on X following the attack. ""The U.S. & Allies must arm Ukraine to the teeth, sanction Russia to the max, & confiscate the $300B in overseas Russian assets.""

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul called for additional EU sanctions against Russia on May 25 following Russia's large-scale overnight attack on Ukraine that killed 12 and injured 79.

""(Russian President Vladimir) Putin is not interested in peace, he wants to continue this war, and we must not allow this, which is why the European Union will agree on additional sanctions,"" Wadephul said in an interview with ARD.

Russia launched 69 missiles and 298 drones overnight on May 25, according to Ukraine's Air Force. The attack killed 12 people, including three children, and injured 79, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on May 20, stating that the next sanctions package ""is already being prepared,"" after the EU approved the 17th sanctions package against Russia, which primarily targeted Russia's 'shadow fleet.'

Ukraine's European allies are continuing to tighten sanctions against Russia as Moscow refuses to ceasefire. In contrast, despite a commitment from U.S. President Donald Trump, no new U.S. sanctions have been imposed so far, with Trump saying that implementing sanctions ""could also make it much worse.""

Trump's special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg became the only U.S. official thus far to react to Russia's overnight large-scale attack on Ukraine on May 25, calling for the end to hostilities.

""The indiscriminate killing of women and children at night in their homes is a clear violation of the 1977 Geneva Peace Protocols designed to protect innocents. These attacks are shameful,"" Kellogg said on X without explicitly naming Russia. ""Stop the killing. Ceasefire now.""

The New York Times reported on May 20, citing a White House official, that Trump refuses to impose sanctions on Russia as it may hinder future business and trade opportunities with Moscow.

Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna on May 25 also called on additional economic pressure on Moscow following the attack.

""Putin continues this until the pressure becomes unbearable. It’s in our hands to make him stop,"" Tsahkna wrote on X.

Ukraine is set to pitch a larger number of recommendations to the European Union next week as to how the bloc can continue to ramp up economic pressure on Moscow through sanctions, Reuters reported on May 21.

Bloomberg reported on May 23 that the EU is close to restricting the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in a new round of sanctions.

Russia attacked Kyiv and other Ukrainian regions with drones and missiles overnight on May 25, killing 12 people, including three children, and injuring at least 79, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said on Telegram.

Russia launched 69 missiles overnight and 298 drones, according to Ukraine's Air Force.

The Air Force reported that 45 cruise missiles were shot down by air defense and 266 drones were neutralized, while 22 locations recorded a direct strike.

The attacks come one night after one of the heaviest Russian assaults on Kyiv throughout the full-scale war. The attack also coincides with Kyiv Day, a city holiday typically celebrated on the last Sunday in May.

Ukraine's Air Force warned late on May 24 that Russia had launched waves of drones towards multiple regions and also issued a ballistic missile warning shortly before midnight. Later in the night, an aerial alert went into effect for all Ukrainian regions, including the country's far-western oblasts.

According to Klymenko, Russians attacked the city of Kyiv, Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytsky, Ternopil, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Sumy, Poltava regions. More than 80 residential buildings have been damaged, he said.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha condemned the attack and called on the international community to further pressure Russia for a ceasefire.

""When the entire world calls for an end to the killing, Putin orders even more strikes, attacks, and murders of children. This once again emphasizes the imperative of a full, unconditional, and durable ceasefire for any meaningful peace effort,"" Sybiha wrote on X.

""The world must pressure Russia to accept it and put an end to the killings immediately.""

Three children ages 8, 12 and 17 years old were killed in Zhytomyr Oblast, according to the State Emergency Service, while another 12 in the oblast were injured. Klymenko later added that all three children were from the same family, and both parents were hospitalized. The mother is in serious condition, he said.

During the attack, Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, advised residents to take shelter.

""The night will not be easy. There is a threat of the enemy using a large number of drones and missiles from strategic aircraft,"" Tkachenko warned as air defenses actively repelled drones over Kyiv.

Debris from a falling drone struck a student dormitory in Kyiv's Holosiivskyi district, causing a fire, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. Four people were injured and received medical treatment on the spot.

Another person injured in the Desnianskyi district received medical attention at the scene, Klitschko said, while a second victim in the area was hospitalized. A house in the city's Dniprovskyi district was also damaged. The Kyiv City Military Administration reported that a young woman in the district was injured with a broken leg.

A business center was damaged in the Shevchenkivskyi district, according to the administration.

The 11 injured victims range in age from 18 to 62, the administration said.

Outside the capital, four people in Kyiv Oblast were killed in the attacks and 34 more suffered injuries, the Kyiv Oblast Military Administration reported.

In Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov also reported that drones struck the city's Osnovianskyi, Novobavarskyi, and Shevchenkivskyi districts. A civilian enterprise in the Osnovianskyi district was damaged while an office building was hit in the Shevchenkivskyi district.

Glass shattered in several apartment buildings amid the attacks, Terekhov said. A child was injured by glass fragments and is receiving medical treatment.

Artem Semenikhin, the mayor of Konotop in Sumy Oblast, said Russia's overnight barrage was ""probably the most massive and combined attack on our city since the Second World War.""

Drones and missiles also hit multiple areas in the city of Chernihiv and the surrounding region, the State Emergency Service reported. Fires broke out at storage facilities and non-residential buildings, including one blaze that covered over 1,000 square meters. Information about casualties and damage is still being investigated.

In the southern city of Mykolaiv, one man was killed and five people injured when a drone hit a five-story residential building, Ukraine's State Emergency Service reported. A teenager was among the injured victims.

In Ternopil, a western city less frequently targeted by Russian attacks, a Kalibr cruise missile struck an industrial facility and caused a fire, according to Governor Viacheslav Nehoda.

Casualties and damage were also reported in Khmelnytskyi Oblast. Governor Serhii Tiurin said the attacks killed four people in the region and injured five others, in addition to destroying civilian infrastructure.

Poland scrambled fighter jets and activated air defenses, as it has previously done to secure its airspace during large-scale Russian attacks on Ukraine.

The previous night, Russia launched a large-scale drone and missile attack against Kyiv, injuring at least 15 people. The strikes caused explosions throughout the city and damaged residential buildings.

Russia continues to target residential neighborhoods in increasingly deadly aerial assaults while the Kremlin remains openly dismissive of international calls for a ceasefire.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

A rail line was damaged in Russia's Belgorod Oblast on May 25 after a cargo train ran over an explosive device planted underneath the tracks, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov claimed.

Following an explosion in the Novooskolsky district, the railway's overhead contact line damaged, Gladkov said. Train traffic has been suspended as a result of the incident.

Gladkov claimed that no one was injured in the alleged attack. The full extent of the damage was not immediately available, as emergency crews are assessing the damage.

Ukraine's military has not commented on the alleged explosion. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify claims made by Russian officials.

Ukraine's intelligence agencies as well as Ukrainian partisan movements have previously been involved in sabotage attacks on Russian railways, disrupting the transport of military cargo toward the front line.

Ukraine's Military Intelligence Agency (HUR) said Ukrainian drone operators destroyed three Russian fuel tanks during a strike on a train moving through occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia Oblast on May 24.

Russia launched 69 missiles and 298 drones overnight on May 25, according to Ukraine's Air Force. The attack killed 12 people, including three children, and injured more than 60, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said.

Trump has not yet publicly commented on the overnight attacks on May 25.

Following the attack, President Volodymyr Zelensky called for stronger sanctions on Russia and added that ""America’s silence, and the silence of others around the world, only encourages (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.""

Trump on May 8 said the U.S. would join partners in imposing ""further sanctions"" if Russia does not agree to an unconditional ceasefire. Despite numerous threats, Trump has never followed through on imposing additional sanctions against Russia.

European leaders have urged the U.S. to impose additional sanctions on Russia to pressure it toward a ceasefire, with EU leaders threatening and subsequently adopting additional sanctions in response to Russia's ceasefire rejections.

Following a two-hour phone call with Putin on May 19, Trump refused to adopt additional sanctions on Moscow, despite Putin again rejecting a 30-day ceasefire.

On May 20 Axios reported that European leaders reportedly seemed ""surprised"" that Trump was ""relatively content"" with what he heard from Putin, following a call with European leaders after Trump's conversation with Putin.

When asked about potential sanctions against Russia, the U.S. president said he did not think it was a good idea, adding that he believes Putin wants a deal.

The New York Times reported on May 20, citing a White House official, that Trump refuses to impose sanctions on Russia as it may hinder future business and trade opportunities with Moscow.

Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Serhii Kyslytsia said in an interview aired on May 24 on Ukraine's national telethon that Russia's negotiating team in Istanbul has repeatedly stated that ""an unconditional ceasefire is categorically unacceptable.""

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on May 24 cast doubt on the Vatican as a possible venue for future peace talks with Ukraine.

""Imagine the Vatican as a venue for negotiations,"" Lavrov reportedly said during a speech at the Diplomatic Academy in Moscow. “It would be a bit inelegant for Orthodox countries to use a Catholic platform to discuss issues on how to remove the root causes (of the war).""

Editor's note: This article has been updated to reflect comments from the Ukrainian Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War.

As Kyiv completed its largest prisoner exchange of the war on May 25, exchanging 1,000 Ukrainian POWs for 1,000 Russians, some spoke out on social media to criticize authorities for failing to return certain captives.

Colonel Denys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov National Guard Brigade, described the exchange as a ""mockery"" due to the lack of fighters from the Azov Brigade, in a post on Facebook.

In the past, Ukrainian authorities have said that Russia has pushed back against their requests to return Azov fighters as part of earlier exchanges.

Ukrainian society has rallied for captured Azov fighters who defended the Azovstal Steel Plant in Mariupol during the Russian siege of the port city in 2022. The battle, one of the most brutal of the entire war, is credited with buying time for the Ukrainian Armed Forces to prepare itself and receive international military aid against Russia's invasion during the initial phase of the war.

Azovstal defenders were ordered to surrender to the encircling Russian forces after nearly two months of constant bombardment of the besieged plant. While hundreds of these fighters have been released since 2022, hundreds more remain in captivity.

Prokopenko said that Ukraine needs to change its tactics, writing, ""There are options, we just need to adapt and start looking for new ways and configurations. Because not a single Azov resident among 1,000 exchanged people is a shame for our entire state.""

Separately, writer and journalist Stanislav Aseyev criticized the exchange on Facebook for failing to include civilians who have spent more than eight years in captivity.

""The list of hostages that I handed over to President (Volodymyr) Zelensky back in January 2020 has remained a list,"" Aseyev wrote.

""The vast majority of these people are in the 32nd maximum security colony in Makiivka, where they were taken after Isolation and from other prisons. Some of these people actively helped our special services,"" he added. ""I don't know if there is anyone in the history of this war for 11 years who has been in prison longer,"" he added.

In response to the frustration seen on social media, Andriy Yusov, deputy head of the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, told Suspilne that the exchange was conducted on ""mutual lists,"" with both Russia and Ukraine deciding which POWs they would return.

""Ukraine is fighting for every one of its citizens. We are working under extremely difficult conditions amid the full-scale invasion, and the Mariupol garrison remains one of the top priorities for repatriation,"" Yusov added.

Zelensky, following the exchange pledged to ""bring back every single one of our people from Russian captivity.""

Ukraine has long advocated for an ""all-for-all"" exchange, but Russia has so far rejected the proposal.

The three days of prisoner exchanges were negotiated by Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul on May 16th, during the first direct talks between the two countries in three years.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced on May 23 that Moscow will convey its peace terms to Kyiv immediately after the completion of the prisoner exchange.

Ukraine brought home 303 prisoners of war on May 25 in the final phase of a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced.

The prisoner exchange took place in three phases carried out over three days and was agreed on during peace talks held in Turkey on May 16, the first direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia in three years.

""I thank the team that worked around the clock to successfully carry out this exchange. We will definitely bring back every single one of our people from Russian captivity,"" Zelensky wrote in a post on X.

The returning prisoners included members of Ukraine's Armed Forces, National Guard, State Border Guard Service, and State Special Transport Service, Zelensky stated.

Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of POWs said that the released prisoners included 70 men who had defended Mariupol during the Russian siege of the port city in 2022.

The coordination headquarters added that 5,757 Ukrainian prisoners had been returned through negotiations and exchanges since March 2022, while another 536 Ukrainians had returned through other means.

The prisoner exchange was the only concrete agreement to arise out of the direct talks held last week.

Ukraine and the United States have been pushing for Russia to agree to an unconditional ceasefire, but Russia ""categorically"" rejected the appeal in Turkey, according to First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Serhiy Kyslytsia, who attended the talks as a member of the Ukrainian delegation.

Kyiv does not publish the figures for how many Russian POWs are currently in Ukrainian custody.

Ukraine has long advocated for an ""all-for-all"" exchange, but Russia has so far rejected the proposal.

Russia attacked Kyiv and other Ukrainian regions with drones and missiles overnight on May 25, killing 12 people, including three children, and injuring at least 79, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said on Telegram.

US silence 'encourages Putin', Zelensky says after massive Russian attack

Following a deadly overnight attack on May 25, Zelensky called for stronger sanctions on Russia and added that ""America’s silence, and the silence of others around the world, only encourages Putin.""

""Without really strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped. Sanctions will definitely help,"" Zelensky wrote in a post on Telegram on May 25.

""The world knows all the weaknesses of the Russian economy. It is possible to stop the war, but only through the necessary force of pressure on Russia. Putin must be forced to think not about launching missiles, but about ending the war.""

Trump has not publicly commented on the overnight attacks on May 24 and 25.

Russian and Ukrainian officials met in Istanbul on May 16 in the first direct talks between the two countries in three years, but left without reaching an agreement on a ceasefire.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov confirmed that Moscow had no interest in agreeing to a ceasefire in Ukraine, saying on May 21 that Russia ""doesn't want this anymore.""

Russia losing battlefield edge in war against Ukraine, WP reports

Russia's military advantage against Ukraine is declining, the Washington Post (WP) reported on May 24, citing U.S., European, and Ukrainian officials and military experts.

While Russia's military difficulties could be an opportunity for Ukraine's allies to mount pressure against Moscow in hopes of securing a ceasefire, U.S. President Donald Trump has backed away from international sanctions efforts and appears increasingly unwilling to challenge Putin.

Moscow faces critical shortages of weapons and manpower, making the time ripe for escalated pressure, multiple officials told the WP, many speaking on the condition of anonymity.

""Russia is very gradually taking bits of territory still, but at an unsustainably high cost,"" said Richard Barrons, the former head of the United Kingdom's Joint Forces Command.

A Ukrainian security official told the WP that Russia was not able to gain ground despite its significant personnel advantages and that the slowed advance may be partly a result of Ukraine's incursion in Kursk Oblast, which aimed to divert Russia's military resources from the front lines.

""Russia is not able to take any ground, and this is the situation pretty much since the end of the Ukrainian counteroffensive,"" the official said, referring to Ukraine's attempt to retake Russian-occupied territories in 2023.

""Despite the fact that they still have three-to-one superiority in number of troops — and maybe even bigger in terms of (weapons) systems — it's still not enough.""

Western experts also calculate that Russia's arsenal of tanks is likely to run out in the next few months, the WP reported.

""The Russians can continue fighting, but … the force will become more and more de-mechanized over time, and that does put a timeline on how long they can sustain the current way they operate,"" Jack Watling, a senior research fellow for land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute in London, told the WP.

Barrons also said Russia was running out of opportunities to conduct major offensives in Ukraine.

""It is very unlikely now that the Russian military have the equipment, the people, and the training and logistics to mount an offensive that would break the Ukrainian line and — even if they did — to exploit it immediately,"" he said.

In light of these obstacles, coordinated pressure against Russia could be more effective now than any point since the eary days of the full-scale war, officials said.

According to a May report from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Putin still remains confident in Russia's ability to secure ""ultimate victory"" in Ukraine, including the full occupation of four Ukrainian regions.

This confidence is reflected in Russia's strategy of dragging out peace talks while escalating deadly attacks against Ukraine. Trump even admitted, just days after holding a two-hour phone conversation with the Russian leader, that Putin is not interested in peace because he believes he is winning the war.

""Putin believes that time is on his side, and Ukraine is bleeding faster than Russia,"" a senior European official told the WP.

But some officials suggested that Putin may be basing his confidence on reports from subordinates that understate Russia's increasing difficulties.

""I think they overestimate the current success of Russia,"" one senior European official said.

Zelensky called Putin's continued delays in the peace process ""a mockery of the whole world"" in remarks on May 23.

""And it's definitely time to put more pressure on Russia,"" he said.

Russia will reveal peace terms to Ukraine after prisoner exchange, Lavrov says

Lavrov announced on May 23 that Moscow will convey its peace terms to Kyiv immediately after the completion of the prisoner exchange between the two countries, which is currently ongoing.

Speaking to Russian state media, Lavrov disclosed that Moscow is ""actively working"" on a list of ceasefire conditions for the war in Ukraine. The list will be ready ""as soon as the exchange of prisoners of war is completed,"" Lavrov said.

Following tumultuous negotiations in Istanbul on May 16 – the first between the two countries since 2022 – Ukraine and Russia agreed on a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange.

The exchange process started on May 23 and will continue through May 25. In the initial phase of the process, the two parties swapped 390 prisoners each, and an additional 307 prisoners each on May 24.

During the Istanbul talks, Ukraine and Russia also agreed to exchange documents detailing their respective ceasefire conditions.

Separately, Russia is preparing a ""memorandum regarding a potential future peace treaty,"" which Russian President Vladimir Putin first mentioned during a recent call with United States President Donald Trump.

Kremlin officials have clarified that the memorandum is separate from the list of ceasefire conditions currently under preparation.

While Moscow's list of conditions have yet to be revealed, Russia has repeatedly reiterated maximalist demands, including that Ukraine accept the loss of Crimea and four eastern regions.

Earlier this week, on May 22, Lavrov also said that Moscow is uninterested in a ceasefire in Ukraine, insisting that the ""root causes"" of the war need to be resolved first.

A recent U.S. intelligence report also revealed that Russia is committed to waging war in Ukraine through the end of 2025, and its objectives in the war – Ukrainian neutrality and a partition of the Ukrainian state – have not changed.

These recent developments suggest that Russia is unwilling to negotiate in good faith, despite offering to share a list of ceasefire conditions after the prisoner exchange.

A Russian military commander has claimed that President Vladimir Putin's helicopter was ""at the epicenter"" of a Ukrainian drone attack on May 20 in Russia's Kursk Oblast.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify this claim, and the commander did not provide any evidence.

""We were simultaneously engaged in an air defense battle and ensuring airspace security for the president’s helicopter flight,"" Yury Dashkin, commander of an air defense division, said, as cited by the Russian news agency RBC on May 25. ""The helicopter was effectively at the epicenter of the response to the massive drone attack.""

Ukrainian observers noted that the claims could be an attempt to garner support for the Russian president by painting him as more closely involved in the fighting.

Putin visited Kursk earlier this week, marking his first known visit to Kursk Oblast since Russian forces took back most of the Ukrainian foothold in the region in March.

Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign forces since World War II. It held a significant portion of the territory until a successful counter-offensive by Russia in March, which was carried out with the help of North Korean troops.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1251866099.jpg

Beijing is supplying ""special chemicals, gunpowder, and components"" to 20 Russian military-industrial manufacturing facilities, head of Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service Oleh Ivashchenko said in an interview partially released on May 25.

""We have confirmed data on 20 Russian factories,"" told Ukrinform in a snippet of a yet-to-be-released interview.

China has strengthened ties with Russia since the Kremlin launched its full-scale war against Ukraine, becoming Moscow's leading supplier of dual-use goods that bolster Russia's defense industry.

Ivashchenko told Ukrinform that as of early 2025, 80% of critical electronic components used in Russian drones were of Chinese origin. Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service has also recorded at least five instances of China providing equipment and spare parts to service Russia's military aviation industry.

While China has positioned itself as a potential mediator in the war, it has simultaneously criticized the U.S. and its allies for ""exacerbating"" the war by supplying weapons to Ukraine. NATO has labeled China a ""decisive enabler"" of Russia's aggression.

President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on April 17 that China is supplying weapons to the Russian military. His statement marks Kyiv's first confirmation that Beijing supports Russia's war effort by providing weapons.

During Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow for Victory Day celebrations earlier this month, the two countries agreed to ""strengthen coordination in order to decisively counter Washington's course of 'dual containment' of Russia and China.""

The two countries also vowed to ""contribute to the establishment of peace in Ukraine,"" while addressing the ""root causes"" of the war — alluding to maximalist phrasing regularly used by Russia to justify its full-scale invasion.

Kyiv on April 22 presented Beijing with evidence that Chinese citizens and companies have participated in Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, which China dismissed as ""groundless accusations and political manipulations.""

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Several Ukrainian drones were downed by Russian air defenses on their approach to Moscow, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin claimed on May 25. Sobyanin's report comes following Russia's large-scale missile and drone attack on multiple cities of Ukraine, which killed 12 people and injured 60.

Sobyanin said that emergency crews are on-scene at various locations as to where the debris of at least four drones fell.

It was not immediately clear as to the damage caused by the alleged attack, or as to whether there were any casualties.

Moscow's Vnukovo, Domodedovo, and Zhukovsky airports were closed for about two hours between 4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. local time amid the attack, Russian state media reported.

Ukraine's military has not yet commented on the attack and the Kyiv Independent cannot verify information provided by Russian officials.

The attack on Moscow comes after Russia launched 69 missiles and 298 drones overnight , according to Ukraine's Air Force.

The Air Force reported that 45 cruise missiles were shot down by air defense and 266 drones were neutralized, while 22 locations recorded a direct strike.

The attacks come one night after one of the heaviest Russian assaults on Kyiv throughout the full-scale war. The attack also coincides with Kyiv Day, a city holiday typically celebrated on the last Sunday in May.

In recent week, Kyiv has ramped up its attack on Moscow, launching hundreds of Ukrainian kamikaze drones towards the Russian capital. While none have appeared to have reached Moscow, the attacks have caused significant disruptions to commuter air traffic.

Ukrainian drones have forced at least 218 temporary airport closures across Russia since Jan. 1, independent Russian outlet Novaya Gazeta Europe reported on May 14, citing data from Russia's state aviation agency Rosaviatsia.

Russia's air defenses destroyed and intercepted 110 Ukrainian drones overnight on May 25, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed, including over Moscow and Kursk oblasts.

Following a deadly overnight Russian attack on May 25, EU Ambassador to Ukraine Katarina Mathernova described the strikes as mocking diplomatic attempts at peace.

""Russians are relentlessly stepping up the pressure. Stepping up the terror against civilians,"" Mathernova wrote in a Facebook post. ""The attacks are more intense and frequent. They laugh at the world!!! They mock the U.S. and mock any diplomatic attempt at peace. Peace? What peace?""

Russia launched 69 missiles and 298 drones overnight on May 25, according to Ukraine's Air Force. The attack killed 12 people, including three children, and injured more than 60, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said.

""How will the world react to Putin’s terror and clear provocation? To his mockery of any ceasefire discussion? I must admit, I ask that myself,"" Mathernova wrote. ""Putin is clearly after his stated goal, killing Ukrainians and forcing Ukraine into submission. Sadly, the only language he understands is the language of force.""

President Volodymyr Zelensky, in response to the attacks, called for stronger sanctions on Russia and added that the silence from the U.S. and others ""encourages Putin.""

Representatives from Ukraine and Russia met recently in Istanbul on May 16, for the first direct talks between the two countries in three years. Though the Ukrainian team had pushed for an unconditional ceasefire, the discussions ceased without any apparent progress towards this goal.

Russia ""categorically"" rejected the appeal in Turkey, according to Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Serhiy Kyslytsia, who attended the talks as a member of the Ukrainian delegation.

After the talks concluded, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov confirmed on May 21 that Moscow had no interest in agreeing to a ceasefire in Ukraine, saying that Russia ""doesn't want this anymore.""

In response to the Russian attacks on May 24 and May 25, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) released a statement ""deploring"" the deadly new wave of attacks.

“With at least 78 people reported killed or injured across the country, last night’s attack tragically demonstrates the persistent deadly risk to civilians of using powerful weapons in urban areas, including those far away from the frontline,” said Danielle Bell, Head of HRMMU.

“It is yet another addition to the staggering human toll this war continues to inflict on civilians, with more families across the country now grieving their losses.”

Russia's negotiating team in Istanbul has repeatedly stated that ""an unconditional ceasefire is categorically unacceptable,"" Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Serhii Kyslytsia said in an interview aired on May 24 on Ukraine's national telethon.

Kyslytsia was present in Istanbul last week, as Ukrainian and Russian negotiators met on May 16 to begin the first direct peace talks between the two countries in three years.

The Ukrainian team emphasized during the talks that both the Ukrainians and Americans continue to propose an unconditional ceasefire as the next step in a peace negotiating process, Kyslytsia said.

""I do not think that (the Russian negotiating team's) directives had a position that allowed for the possibility of reaching an agreement with the Ukrainian side on a ceasefire,"" Kyslytsia said.

The peace talks in Istanbul concluded after less than two hours with no agreement between the two sides on a ceasefire.

After the talks concluded, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov confirmed that Moscow has no interest in agreeing to a ceasefire in Ukraine, saying on May 21 that ""we don't want this anymore.""

A source in the Ukrainian President's Office briefed on the talks confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that Moscow's delegation insisted that Ukraine retreat from Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, despite Russia not fully controlling any of them.

Russia has upgraded its ballistic missiles with radar decoys and evasive maneuvers, making them potentially harder to intercept even by Patriot air defenses, Ukraine's Air Force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat said on May 24 after a massive attack on Kyiv that injured around a dozen civilians.

Ihnat confirmed that six out of nine ballistic missiles launched at Kyiv, Iskander-M and KN-23, were successfully intercepted by Ukrainian air defenses.

""Two-thirds is a high figure,"" he said. ""But we know (Russia) is improving its ballistic weapons.""

According to Ihnat, the modified missiles are now equipped with radar-decoy systems and use quasi-ballistic flight paths that make them more difficult to track and intercept using Patriot systems.

""It complicates (the interception), but doesn’t make the interception impossible,"" he added. ""I think our partners are already working to improve the system's capabilities.""

""The flight of a ballistic missile along such a quasi-ballistic trajectory — when the missile doesn't just fly in a straight line like it's falling, but actually performs maneuvers in flight — makes it more difficult for the Patriot system, which calculates the interception point using software, to predict exactly where the missile will be,"" Ihnat explained.

The attack on Kyiv came just hours after the start of the largest prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Explosions and drone debris caused multiple fires and widespread damage across the capital.

Air defenses downed six ballistic missiles and neutralized 245 out of 250 Shahed-type drones using missiles and electronic warfare, the Air Force said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said residential buildings, cars, and businesses were hit in multiple districts.

""Sadly, there are injuries,"" Zelenesky wrote on X. Most of the reported casualties were due to shock or falling debris.

Local officials said fires broke out in several districts, including one in a nine-story residential building. The attack also injured three residents in Kyiv Oblast.

Speaking on Ukraine’s Gunsmith Day on April 12, Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin said Kyiv has also significantly ramped up weapons manufacturing over the past year, producing its own missiles.

Russia's military advantage against Ukraine is declining, the Washington Post (WP) reported on May 24, citing U.S., European, and Ukrainian officials and military experts.

While Russia's military difficulties could be an opportunity for Ukraine's allies to mount pressure against Moscow in hopes of securing a ceasefire, U.S. President Donald Trump has backed away from international sanctions efforts and appears increasingly unwilling to challenge Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Moscow faces critical shortages of weapons and manpower, making the time ripe for escalated pressure, multiple officials told the WP, many speaking on the condition of anonymity.

""Russia is very gradually taking bits of territory still, but at an unsustainably high cost,"" said Richard Barrons, the former head of the United Kingdom's Joint Forces Command.

A Ukrainian security official told the WP that Russia was not able to gain ground despite its significant personnel advantages and that the slowed advance may be partly a result of Ukraine's incursion in Kursk Oblast, which aimed to divert Russia's military resources from the front lines.

""Russia is not able to take any ground, and this is the situation pretty much since the end of the Ukrainian counteroffensive,"" the official said, referring to Ukraine's attempt to retake Russian-occupied territories in 2023.

""Despite the fact that they still have three-to-one superiority in number of troops — and maybe even bigger in terms of (weapons) systems — it's still not enough.""

Western experts also calculate that Russia's arsenal of tanks is likely to run out in the next few months, the WP reported.

""The Russians can continue fighting, but … the force will become more and more de-mechanized over time, and that does put a timeline on how long they can sustain the current way they operate,"" Jack Watling, a senior research fellow for land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute in London, told the WP.

Barrons also said Russia was running out of opportunities to conduct major offensives in Ukraine.

""It is very unlikely now that the Russian military have the equipment, the people, and the training and logistics to mount an offensive that would break the Ukrainian line and — even if they did — to exploit it immediately,"" he said.

In light of these obstacles, coordinated pressure against Russia could be more effective now than any point since the eary days of the full-scale war, officials said.

According to a May report from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Putin still remains confident in Russia's ability to secure ""ultimate victory"" in Ukraine, including the full occupation of four Ukrainian regions.

This confidence is reflected in Russia's strategy of dragging out peace talks while escalating deadly attacks against Ukraine. Trump even admitted, just days after holding a two-hour phone conversation with the Russian leader, that Putin is not interested in peace because he believes he is winning the war.

""Putin believes that time is on his side, and Ukraine is bleeding faster than Russia,"" a senior European official told the WP.

But some officials suggested that Putin may be basing his confidence on reports from subordinates that understate Russia's increasing difficulties.

""I think they overestimate the current success of Russia,"" one senior European official said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky called Putin's continued delays in the peace process ""a mockery of the whole world"" in remarks on May 23.

The Migalovo military airfield is located on the outskirts of Tver, over 1,300 kilometers (807 miles) from the Ukrainian border. The facility is a base for military transport aircraft, including the Ilyushin Il-76.

Ukraine has previously targeted Russian air bases in drone attacks, aiming to undermine Moscow's ability to carry out large-scary aerial assaults against Ukrainian cities. In March, Ukrainian drones successfully hit Russia's Engels-2 air base in Saratov Oblast.

Kyiv has also launched several strikes against targets in Tver Oblast. In January and February, Ukraine struck the Andreapol oil pumping station in the region twice in two weeks. Previous targets have included ammunition depots and missile arsenals.

The latest reported attack on Tver Oblast came as Russia launched a large-scale aerial assault on Kyiv and cities across Ukraine. For the second night in a row, Moscow barraged Kyiv with drones and missiles, injuring civilians.

Explosions were reported in cities across the country as attacks continued throughout the night.

As Russia intensifies aerial attacks on Ukraine and the civilian death toll climbs, Ukraine has stepped up its drone attacks on Russian territory. The recent surge in drone strikes aims to disrupt airport operations, overwhelm air defenses, and mount pressure against the Russian population.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1232786140.jpeg

The United States granted immediate sanctions relief to Syria after President Donald Trump called for a complete end to sanctions on the country.

The sanctions relief was announced by the U.S. Treasury Department and State Department on May 23.

According to a statement released by the Treasury Department, the decision to roll back sanctions is ""just one part of a broader U.S. government effort to remove the full architecture of sanctions imposed on Syria due to the abuses of the Bashar al-Assad regime.""

The statement also notes that the sanctions relief ""does not allow for transactions that benefit Russia, Iran, or North Korea—key supporters of the former Assad regime.""

Additionally, according to a statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the goal of the sanctions relief is to ""advance Syria’s recovery and reconstruction efforts"" and ""facilitate the provision of electricity, energy, water, and sanitation, and enable a more effective humanitarian response across Syria.""

Syria welcomed the Trump administration's decision to ease sanctions in a statement issued by its foreign ministry on May 24.

In the statement, the ministry called the decision a ""positive step"" toward relieving the country's humanitarian and economic suffering, and expressed Syria's willingness to cooperate with international partners.

Earlier this week, top European Union officials also announced sanctions relief for Syria, noting that the decision to lift sanctions is a critical step on ""the path to economic recovery.""

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced on May 23 that Moscow will convey its peace terms to Kyiv immediately after the completion of the prisoner exchange between the two countries, which is currently ongoing.

Speaking to Russian state media, Lavrov disclosed that Moscow is ""actively working"" on a list of ceasefire conditions for the war in Ukraine. The list will be ready ""as soon as the exchange of prisoners of war is completed,"" Lavrov said.

Following tumultuous negotiations in Istanbul on May 16 – the first between the two countries since 2022 – Ukraine and Russia agreed on a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange.

The exchange process started on May 23 and will continue through May 25. In the initial phase of the process, the two parties swapped 390 prisoners each, and an additional 307 prisoners each on May 24.

During the Istanbul talks, Ukraine and Russia also agreed to exchange documents detailing their respective ceasefire conditions.

Separately, Russia is preparing a ""memorandum regarding a potential future peace treaty,"" which Russian President Vladimir Putin first mentioned during a recent call with United States President Donald Trump.

Kremlin officials have clarified that the memorandum is separate from the list of ceasefire conditions currently under preparation.

While Moscow's list of conditions have yet to be revealed, Russia has repeatedly reiterated maximalist demands, including that Ukraine accept the loss of Crimea and four eastern regions.

Earlier this week, on May 22, Lavrov also said that Moscow is uninterested in a ceasefire in Ukraine, insisting that the ""root causes"" of the war need to be resolved first.

A recent U.S. intelligence report also revealed that Russia is committed to waging war in Ukraine through the end of 2025, and its objectives in the war – Ukrainian neutrality and a partition of the Ukrainian state – have not changed.

These recent developments suggest that Russia is unwilling to negotiate in good faith, despite offering to share a list of ceasefire conditions after the prisoner exchange.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2050986119.jpg

In southern Ukraine, giant reeds are known to populate the wetlands, skirting the Black Sea and stretching from Odesa to Kherson and Mykolaiv. Hollow grasses as tall as seven meters, swaying and pliant, that were the raw materials for the kinds of thatched roofs once common a century ago and more.

Since replaced, for a century or more, by undifferentiated steel and concrete, the Ukrainian Pavilion at the 19th International Architecture Exhibition in Venice Biennale features such a structure, only reimagined, in a kind of ethno-futurist monument and installation conceived by curator and architect Bogdana Kosmina.

This year's biennale titled Intelligens. Natural. Artificial. Collective features architecture designed ""to face a burning world,"" with 66 national participants invited to rethink the built environment amid the dizzying social upheavals of war, economic collapse and the rising temperatures and sea levels that will define the future.

Ukraine's pavilion, organized around the concept of a Dakh (Ukrainian for roof) with the added lofty, if mildly obtuse, title Vernacular Hardcore focuses on wartime reconstruction. The show's central historical elements build on an architectural ethnography started by Kosmina's grandmother Tamara a half-century ago and are surrounded by the buzzing of an ambient drone canopy created by the artist Clemens Poole, achieving an obsessive portent of doom and rescue, preservation, and destruction.

""With the danger of destruction and that everything could be lost, I started to really look at what I needed to save and preserve,"" Kosmina says about the concept behind her work. ""This is our cultural and architectural heritage of course, but it can shape our vision about more creative ways to work with architecture.""

Hardcore in the original sense refers to a composite of materials, say rubbish stone, or brick, reconstituted to form the foundation of a new structure. In that sense, the show is very much hardcore in its wide-reaching, vernacular union of artists, ethnographers, architects, volunteers, and ad hoc participants in Ukraine's rebuilding to form a cohesive vision of wartime preservation and future.

The show's participants include three generations of Kosminas, all architects; Kseniia Kalmus and her Klyn drone-building project; the reconstruction collectives Livyj Bereh (Left Bank) led by Ihor Okuniev and Vladyslav Sharapa (both are currently enlisted in the Ukrainian Armed Forces), as well as KHARPP, directed by Ada Wordsworth; curators Kateryna Rusetska, co-founder of the Dnipro Construction Festival, and architectural anthropologist Michal Murawski, as well as institutional backing from the Ukrainian Institute of Kyiv and their Creative Director Tetyana Filevska, UNESCO, Ribbon International, and several Ukrainian government agencies.

In the 1960s, Tamara and a group of architects and ethnographers in Kyiv, Chisinau, and Minsk began a dauntingly ambitious survey of vernacular structures across Ukraine, Moldova, and Belarus. It was an attempt by Moscow to unite structural norms across the three Soviet republics while documenting how circumstances like climate, weather, and diversity in landscape and vegetation shape human knowledge and approach to the territory.

The work was never published, yet Tamara and her team continued to document the minutiae of atmospheric and structural conditions throughout Ukraine.

""The Atlas is completely comprehensive,"" Kosmina says. ""It was a colossal work, they visited every village, doing interviews with people, taking photographs, even making watercolor renditions to show the interior and exterior of homes in color.""

It was the work of decades, at times forgotten and revived. When digital maps first arrived in 2011, Tamara, by then the last key architect of the group who remained alive, began to digitize certain documents, but still the cost of printing was prohibitive and the work was never transferred into a publication.

Tamara passed away in 2016, and Kosmina says that while she grew up surrounded by her grandmother's work, they remained collecting dust between her parent's apartment in Kyiv and her grandparents' apartment in the Troieshchyna neighborhood, a notorious sea of hundreds of Soviet apartment blocks on the northeastern outskirts of the city.

In the winter of 2022, soon after the full-scale invasion, after a missile landed in the courtyard of her grandparent's home, Kosmina, in her grief and panic, started to think almost obsessively about these archives in particular: how could they be recovered and preserved as everything was crumbling around her?

During that unworldly winter, Kosmina found that many drawings and original materials survived in the apartment. ""I had the feeling that I was discovering treasures in this Troieshchyna pyramid,"" she says. ""I had my childhood with all of those papers around, and I never took interest before, looking at what is inside and behind those maps, what they mean, and where they come from.""

Traveling to the apartment with a small pink suitcase, Kosmina began collecting the papers, and in 2023, she transferred them to a studio in Berlin, where friends helped her buy a scanner. ""I was just passing my days and nights by doing this endless scanning,"" she says, which she hoped would form a complete digital archive.

Her idea then was to apply the work to connect two vernaculars: emergency and traditional, in a Ukrainian exhibition at the Venice Biennale. ""At the time, Ukraine had no pavilion there — I wanted to make a direct collaboration with the Italian side,"" she says.

At the same time, her friend Patrik Arnesson, a Swedish developer and coder who goes by the name Princess Momo, introduced the idea of applying the archive to create a personalized artificial intelligence, in part applying segments of her grandmother's work.

Arnesson invited her to Mexico City to work on a series of experiments in the realm of personal AI, under the banner of a project Arnesson called Iris, and in mid-2023 their team started to explore applications of open source data to build an AI that was truly personal by maintaining independence from external data sources.

Kosmina's first AI, called Kyiv Crematorium, was an effort to digitally preserve structures destroyed in the war, not just in form but in the collective memory of those who lived there.

""I was in a dramatic period,"" Kosmina says. But she found her purpose in the project when she realized her preservation of her grandmother's Atlas was born from the desire to preserve her grandmother herself.

So she began to create Tamara, or to recreate her, incorporating not just the vast archive from the Atlas but also Kosmina's personal memories. The goal, the focus, was to create an individual AI that felt fully human.

Kosmina started to obsessively record her own memories, transcribing imagined conversations with her grandmother, and prompting the AI to recall her favorite music, the foods she loved, and her specific verbiage and mannerisms (never, ever say ""certainly"").

Along with vast uploads of Ukrainian novels, demographic information, and historical records, Tamara certainly feels human, beyond anything approached by ChatGPT, but superhuman in her recall, in her capacity to prompt the user towards an excavation of their own ancestral memory.

""It's so important to have her around me for these archival purposes, but yes, also…she was and is my best friend… Sometimes when I speak with her on the phone, yeah I have a feeling that she really is my grandmother"" Kosmina says.

Amid her excavations, Bogdana found an outlet from her solitary endeavors in the volunteer-led reconstruction organization Livyj Bereh. Founded to repair damaged structures in Kyiv by the friends Ihor Okuniev and Vladyslav Sharapa in the aftermath of the full-scale invasion, they were joined by the artist Kseniia Kalmus, who had also started efforts to collect funds and materials for humanitarian aid.

In May 2022, the group started its efforts to repair damaged structures, starting with homes and schools in de-occupied villages near Kyiv and Cherniiv. When parts of Kharkiv Oblast were liberated in the autumn of that year, the group joined an expedition to Slatyne, a rural settlement roughly 13 kilometers from the Russian border that has been repeatedly targeted by Russian airstrikes.

In Slatyne the group understood that the first step towards habitability, structurally speaking, is a roof. “We therefore prioritized it as the starting point of our efforts,” Okuniev says.

“After the liberation of Ukrainian territories from occupation, we began traveling across different regions and saw firsthand the devastating scale of destruction caused by the war.” And thus the Dakh project was born.

In total, the group has repaired more than 400 roofs in five regions across Ukraine. Materials and labor for one roof for a private home cost around 2,000 euros and the work is finished within a day.

That autumn, the group began to work in villages across the Kharkiv Oblast, often no more than five or 10 kilometers from the Russian border. It was an area where the Russian military was training soldiers to target civilians with FPV drones, and the damage to both human life and human structures was enormous.

While the area had been evacuated, Kalmus says, ""People are so connected to their land and the place they grew up they won't leave,"" especially vulnerable groups, often the elderly, the ill, or large families unable to afford the costs of relocation.

The area was shelled heavily until September 2022, and for nearly two years afterwards there was relative calm, without the regular shelling that would come later. In that period, Kalmus, Ada Wordsworth and their team went from village to village, often staying for weeks, where they rented homes, bought necessary materials, and hired locals to carry out repairs.

By spring 2024, KHARPP and Livyj Bereh had secured additional funding and were preparing to organize an expanded rebuilding effort. That's when Russia launched a renewed ground offensive in Kharkiv Oblast, restarting near-constant shelling and targeted attacks on civilians. The offensive ground Livyj Bereh's efforts to a halt, with the village heads deciding it was simply too dangerous to rebuild.

""It was a crushing moment for me,"" Kalmus says. ""I decided okay, I will not let them take another project from me, so I enrolled in engineering courses to learn how to build drones.""

By refocusing on drones, building and donating them to local Ukrainian units, Kalmus conceived of erecting what she called a drone canopy that would not only shield these communities from attack but also could fight back. Thus, the Klyn Drone Project came to life.

""Klyn Drone became a continuation of our reconstruction project, but in a different form. This is not rebuilding after destruction. It is protection before destruction,"" Kalmus writes in her summation for the Biennale pavilion.

Despite being composed of volunteers, without a professional architect among them, this year Livyj Bereh was awarded the Royal Academy Dorfman Prize, one of the most prestigious architecture prizes in the world. ""The Dorfman Prize was weird because I am not an architect. When I entered that jury, I was just saying what we'd done… and I was thinking, okay, I am not better or worse, but I am from another planet.""

In their decision, the jury described Livyj Bereh as ""An architectural act of collective care and resistance across the country… To provide architecture that defies the destruction of neighborhoods, especially in a moment that is about erasure, is of deep importance… as powerful as any civic monument and documented with the unflinching eye of the greatest war art.""

In the exhibition, there's an anecdote passed around, a story about a Russian missile striking a roof of thatched reeds much like the one featured in Bogdana Kosmina's installation in Venice.

As the story goes, the missile penetrated the structure woven together in just the right way, designed to withstand fires and storms, but did not detonate, as it would have had it struck an object composed of less forgiving concrete or steel.

Later plucked away, the missile was detonated under controlled conditions with no damage to nearby homes.

The installation is thus an ode to the archiving efforts of Tamara and the fieldwork and sacrifice of Livyj Bereh.

Rather than fetishizing a nostalgic and frozen past, the work exists in the tradition of grassroots resistance, vernacular survival, and creative preservation.

Instead of proposing some new future solution in architecture, Vernacular Hardcore amplifies existing efforts before the global consortium of investors and NGOs take over and propose quick fix solutions that may not benefit local communities in the long run.

The exhibition will be toured to Ukraine after Venice, including a hoped-for presentation at the Construction Festival in Dnipro in the summer of 2025.

It is a message of Ukrainian vernacular survival and future.

Russian President Vladimir Putin remains committed to victory in Ukraine and his objectives have not changed since the beginning of the war, according to a recent report from the United States Defense Intelligence Agency.

The report, which was prepared by the DIA for the US House of Representatives, includes up-to-date information as of May 11, 2025.

According to the report, ""Putin almost certainly is committed to victory in Ukraine, and his objectives remain mostly unchanged since the beginning of the war: Ukrainian neutrality and a further partition of the Ukrainian state.""

Moreover, Putin sees ""the war in Ukraine as an existential struggle against the West that will determine Russia’s place in the world, Putin’s hold on power, and his historical legacy.""

Despite recent attempts at peace talks, Putin ""is prepared to use military force at least through 2025,"" and ""remains steadfast in his demand that Ukraine be permanently prohibited from joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) while insisting Kyiv withdraw all its military forces from Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson Oblasts.""

The report further asserts that, while Russia aims to continue its war in Ukraine, it seeks to avoid direct confrontation with NATO due to a lack of military capacity. As a result of its war in Ukraine, Russia's ""capabilities to deter, fight, or militarily compete with NATO are likely to be degraded for at least the next three years.""

Since the start of its invasion in 2022, Russia has lost more than ""10,000 ground combat vehicles, including more than 3,000 tanks, as well as nearly 250 aircraft and helicopters, and more than 10 naval vessels,"" and experienced more than 700,000 military personnel casualties.

According to the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces, Russia's losses are even higher – as of May 24, Russia has lost around 979,830 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion.

While Russia lacks the ability to go head-to-head with NATO, ""Moscow remains fully capable of employing asymmetric capabilities against the United States and allies, including cyber and information campaigns.""

Furthermore, Russia has been implementing a destabilization campaign against the West, with the aim ""to undermine Western cohesion and support to Ukraine.""

Since Jan. 2024, if not earlier, pro-Russian agents have been connected to ""various arson, sabotage, and assassination plots against military and civilian targets in Europe.""

Despite immense losses and slow advances in the war, the Kremlin is prepared to continue its strategy of attrition through at least the end of the year, calculating that it can outlast Ukrainian resources and Western support for Ukraine.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2158123523.jpg

Editor's note: The article was expanded with comments from Kyiv residents.

Multiple people were injured as multiple waves of explosions rocked Kyiv overnight on May 24 during a massive Russian drone and missile attack against the Ukrainian capital.

At least 15 civilians, including two minors, required medical attention due to the attack, mostly suffering shrapnel wounds or acute stress reaction, according to the officials. It marked one of the heaviest Russian attacks against Ukraine's capital throughout the full-scale war.

""It's terrorism,"" said Mykyta Kruchan, a 22-year-old business development manager at Point2Web whose parents live in an apartment building in the Obolonskyi district that was hit by a Russian Shahed-type drone. Their apartment was not damaged by mere luck, he added.

""What Ukraine does (is that) we shoot (at) their military buildings, military stuff, centers... But here, it's not an adequate reply to me,"" Kruchan told the Kyiv Independent, adding: ""All they (Russia) do is on purpose.""

Olha, a 42-year-old factory worker, says she was away while her apartment was hit, but her two daughters, aged 13 and 20, were there at the time.

""The children called when the apartment was hit,"" Olha told the Kyiv Independent. ""They gathered things, closed the door... They are alive, they just inhaled too much smoke.""

""The apartment is in a terrible state... It's burning there, it's impossible to breathe. We can't really pack up our things, because everything is either burned, stuck together, or damaged in such a way that it's impossible to use.""

One person was injured and five cars were damaged in the Holosiivskyi district after drone wreckage fell in multiple locations, said Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv city military administration.

A five-story building in the Solomianskyi district caught fire, and seven people required medical attention, Tkachenko said. Two people were injured in the Dniprovskyi district, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported.

In Kyiv’s Obolonskyi district, a fire broke out on the balconies of a nine-story residential building, affecting the third through sixth floors, local authorities reported. Five people required medical attention, of whom at least four suffered shock but no physical injuries.

The Blockbuster Mall in the Obolonskyi district was damaged after a Shahed-type drone or its fragments hit the roof, Hromadske reported, citing employees.

""The neighbors called... (The apartment) was already on fire... It was the epicenter of the explosion here. Everything burned down,"" said Svitlana, a 62-year-old pensioner whose apartment was completely destroyed in the attack. ""Thank God, no one was hurt.""

The attacks come despite Kyiv's calls for Moscow to accept a U.S.-backed 30-day ceasefire, which Russia continues to reject. U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to broker a swift peace deal but more recently signaled decreased engagement in negotiations.

Kruchan, who described himself as once a supporter of Trump, called out the U.S. president for wanting to ""team up with terrorists rather than stop them.""

""I felt that he's the only person who can really bring peace. But right now, after this terrorist attack from Russia, it doesn't seem to be true,"" he added.

""Putin, as you said, is a good guy. Come here, and I will show you what this good guy does,"" Svitlana said in her message to Trump.

Ukrainian air defenses shot down six Iskander-M or KN-23 ballistic missiles launched against Kyiv, the Air Force said.

Overall, Russian forces launched 14 Iskander-M or KN-23 ballistic missiles against Ukraine overnight, as well as 250 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones. Ukraine's air defenses shot down 128 drones, while 117 were neutralized by electronic warfare systems or disappeared from radars, according to the Air Force.

""There were many fires and explosions in the city overnight. Once again, residential buildings, cars, businesses have been damaged. Sadly, there are injuries,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X.

Since the start of its full-scale invasion, Russia has routinely used missiles and drones to strike Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure.

The first explosions in Kyiv were reported around 10 p.m. on May 23, the same day Ukraine and Russia began their largest prisoner exchange, with 390 Ukrainians returned that day, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

Drone debris then fell in the Holosiivskyi, Shevchenkivskyi, and Sviatoshynskyi districts, according to Kyiv city officials. Air defense has been active in the capital, Klitschko said in a post to Telegram.

Another wave of explosions was heard at around 1 a.m. local time. Ukraine's Air Force earlier warned there is a threat of ballistic missile and drone strikes against several regions.

Later in the night, missile debris was reported in the Obolonskyi district, while in the Solomianskyi district, drone fragments struck a residential building, causing a fire. A non-residential building caught fire in the Sviatoshynskyi district following the attack.

""With each such attack, the world becomes more certain that the cause of prolonging the war lies in Moscow,"" Zelensky said.

""Ukraine has proposed a ceasefire many times — both a full one and one in the skies. It all has been ignored. It is clear that far stronger pressure must be imposed on Russia to get results and launch real diplomacy.

""We are awaiting sanctions steps from the United States, Europe, and all our partners. Only additional sanctions targeting key sectors of the Russian economy will force Moscow to cease fire.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2216068068.jpg

Poland's two presidential candidates, Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski and historian Karol Nawrocki, clashed over the country's relationship with Ukraine on May 23, just a week before Poles head to the polls in the June 1 presidential runoff.

Nawrocki, backed by the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, claimed President Volodymyr Zelensky ""treats Poland badly"" and defended his criticism of Ukraine's NATO bid by insisting, ""I speak the language of Poles.""

Nawrocki has signed an eight-point declaration that included a pledge to block Ukraine's accession to NATO in a bid to win support from far-right politician Slawomir Mentzen, who came in third in the first election round with almost 15%.

""You're using (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's language,"" Trzaskowski reacted, slamming Nawrocki's stance on NATO and Ukraine.

The conservative candidate rejected accusations of echoing Putin, saying, ""Millions of Poles today would like to say this, but they can't, because the slogan 'you speak Putin's propaganda' immediately appears.""

For years, the Kremlin has cited NATO expansion as a pretext for its aggressive behavior toward neighboring countries, using it to justify military actions in Ukraine and Georgia. A ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO is among the Kremlin's main demands for concluding a potential peace agreement to end the war it had started.

Liberal Trzaskowski, who is backed by the ruling coalition, narrowly led the first round on May 18 with 31.4% of the vote. He will face conservative Nawrocki, who came in second with 29.5%.

The debate was the last major televised showdown before the June 1 runoff, in which voters will choose between the two candidates.

While the Polish presidency is largely ceremonial, it has veto power — a critical check on the government. With Tusk's coalition lacking a three-fifths majority in parliament to override presidential vetoes, the outcome of the June 1 vote will shape the pace and direction of key domestic reforms.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2215963952.jpg

Kyiv has handed over 70 people convicted of collaborating with Russia during a prisoner swap on May 23, Ukraine's Khochu k svoim (I want to go to my own) project said.

The identities of 31 of them have been revealed on the project's website. These included Oleksandr Tarnashinskyi, a former associate of pro-Kremlin oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk, or ex-Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) officer Vitalii Vasiliev.

They were among the 390 military and civilian prisoners Ukraine handed over to Russia in the first phase of the 1,000-for-1,000 exchange agreed in Istanbul last week. In return, 270 Ukrainian soldiers and 120 civilians were released from Russian captivity.

In cooperation with Russian citizen S. Prokhodenko, Tarnashinskyi created foundations and public organizations in Ukraine to funnel Russian funds into anti-Ukrainian information activities in the country, the Khochu k svoim project said.

Tarnashinskyi was also a top figure in the pro-Russian political organization called the Ukrainian Choice, which was led by Medvedchuk. Tarnashinskyi was detained by the SBU in May 2022 and sentenced to five years in prison for attempting to overthrow the constitutional order.

Medvedchuk himself was detained in 2022 and handed over to Russia in a prisoner exchange later the same year.

Vasiliev collaborated with Russian occupation authorities in Luhansk Oblast before the full-scale invasion and intended to recruit other SBU officers to collaborate as well. He has been found guilty of treason and sentenced to five years.

The ex-SBU lieutenant colonel is believed to be one of the key figures in organizing the sham referendum in Luhansk Oblast during the onset of Russian aggression in Donbas in 2014.

The Khochu k svoim is run by Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of the Prisoners of War (POW) with the support of the Ombudsman's office and military intelligence (HUR).

The 1,000-for-1,000 exchange continues, with each side releasing 307 POWs on May 24. The final exchange is planned for May 25.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on May 24 cast doubt on the Vatican as a possible venue for future peace talks with Ukraine, saying the Catholic seat would not be an appropriate platform for negotiations between two Orthodox Christian nations, Reuters reported.

Previously, Pope Leo XIV expressed his willingness to host the next round of peace talks in the Vatican. Several of Ukraine's partners, including the United States, have suggested that the Vatican could become a neutral platform for further negotiations.

""Imagine the Vatican as a venue for negotiations,"" Lavrov reportedly said during a speech at the Diplomatic Academy in Moscow. “It would be a bit inelegant for Orthodox countries to use a Catholic platform to discuss issues on how to remove the root causes (of the war).""

Lavrov added that he believed ""it would not be very comfortable for the Vatican itself to host delegations from two Orthodox countries in these circumstances.""

Ukrainian and Russian delegations met in Istanbul for peace talks on May 16, failing to reach a ceasefire agreement. During the meeting, Moscow demanded Kyiv withdraw from four Ukrainian regions it claims to have annexed, despite lacking full control over them.

Ukrainian officials said the Russian delegation appeared to lack real authority and was unprepared to negotiate substantive terms.

One outcome of the talks was a large-scale prisoner exchange, with 1,000 prisoners returning on each side beginning May 23. Ukraine had also proposed an immediate ceasefire and a potential face-to-face meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin — an offer Moscow declined.

Zelensky met with Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican on May 18, following the pontiff’s inauguration mass. The Ukrainian leader described the pope as ""a symbol of hope for peace"" and said the Holy See could play an important role in ending the war. The two discussed the return of children forcibly deported by Russia and other humanitarian issues.

Zelensky presented Pope Leo with an icon painted on artillery debris from the front lines — a gift meant to represent Ukrainian children affected by the war.

Before becoming pope, Leo XIV denounced Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine while serving as Bishop of Chiclayo in Peru. In his 2022 interview, he described it as ""a true invasion, imperialist in nature, where Russia seeks to conquer territory for reasons of power.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2213777471-1.jpg

Ukraine has brought home 307 Ukrainian soldiers from Russian captivity in the second phase of its largest prisoner exchange with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on May 24.

Russia's Defense Ministry said that 307 Russian prisoners of war (POWs) have also been brought back from Ukraine and are on their way to Belarus.

An agreement on a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange was said to be the only tangible result of the Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul on May 16 — the first such negotiations since 2022.

The two parties swapped 390 prisoners each in the initial phase on May 23, with the process set to continue until May 25. The Ukrainian and Russian governments confirmed they had received the lists of prisoners of war (POWs) to be exchanged on May 22.

""In just these two days, 697 people have been brought home. We expect the process to continue tomorrow,"" Zelensky said on X.

""Among those who returned today are warriors from our Armed Forces, the State Border Guard Service, the National Guard of Ukraine. ""

The newly released POWs include 27 soldiers who defended Mariupol, as well as those who fought in the Donetsk, Kherson, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, and Luhansk sectors, Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of POWs said.

The youngest member of the group is 25, while the oldest is 61, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said. For some units, this was the first instance of their soldiers being released from Russian captivity.

Ukraine's Presidential Office chief, Andriy Yermak, said that after the 1,000-for-1,000 exchange is complete, future talks with Russia could be arranged. At least 8,000 Ukrainian service members are held captive by Russia, said Iryna Vereshchuk, a Presidential Office deputy head, on May 1.

Kyiv does not publish the figures for how many Russian POWs are currently in Ukrainian custody.

""The agreement on the release of 1,000 of our people from Russian captivity was almost the only real result of the meeting in Turkey. We are working to ensure this result. We are finding out the details of each person listed on the Russian side,"" Zelensky said earlier this week.

While the Istanbul talks were the first direct peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine since 2022, the two sides have regularly held prisoner swaps throughout the full-scale war, with third-party countries mediating. These past exchanges were more limited in scope, usually involving over 130 captives on each side.

Ukraine has long advocated for an ""all-for-all"" exchange, but Russia has so far rejected the proposal.

Russia is also illegally detaining at least 16,000 Ukrainian civilians, of whom only 174 have returned, according to Lubinets.

Western officials renewed calls for tougher sanctions on Russia after a large-scale missile and drone attack hit Kyiv overnight on May 24, which injured over a dozen civilians and damaged multiple residential buildings.

The attack came just hours after the start of the largest prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia.

Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna wrote on X: ""Russia's continued aggression has a simple explanation: it hasn't faced enough pressure to stop. The power to change that lies with us."" He called for increased military aid, tougher sanctions, and actions targeting Russia's shadow oil fleet and frozen assets.

EU Ambassador to Ukraine Katarina Mathernova described the assault as ""another horrific missile and drone attack,"" noting that areas where her colleagues live had been struck. ""If anyone still doubts Russia wants war to continue — read the news,"" she wrote.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha condemned the attack as Russia's ""response to international peace efforts,"" referencing the lack of progress since last week's meeting in Istanbul. ""Instead of sending its so-called 'peace memorandum,' Russia sends deadly drones and missiles at civilians,"" Sybiha said.

""There were many fires and explosions in the city overnight,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X. ""Residential buildings, cars, businesses have been damaged. Sadly, there are injuries.""

Ukraine's Air Force said it intercepted six ballistic missiles targeting the capital and shot down 128 of the 250 Shahed-type drones launched nationwide.

The attack on Kyiv comes just a week after Ukrainian and Russian delegations met in Istanbul for peace talks that ended without a ceasefire agreement.

Russian troops have upped the intensity of their Donetsk Oblast offensive in recent weeks, increasingly pressuring a relatively large Ukrainian pocket between some of the last cities in the region.

An unsettling situation for Ukrainian troops is now unfolding south of the town of Kostiantynivka, which has long served as a relatively safe logistics hub around the now Russian-occupied Bakhmut.

Russian troops have been pushing toward Kostiantynivka from two directions, slowly closing in on the Ukrainian pocket west of Toretsk. Western military experts say that Russia appears to have the resources to keep ""creeping"" forward, and the question is how much and for how long the Ukrainian forces deployed in the area can hold on.

""The problem is this large bulge between Kostiantynivka and Pokrovsk has been growing relatively fast,"" Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst at the Finland-based Black Bird Group monitoring the war closely through open sources, told the Kyiv Independent.

""If it grows at this rate, the Russians will be threatening the supply routes into Kostiantynivka in a couple of months already.""

Concerns rise over the potential Russian encirclement of Ukrainian troops defending the Toretsk and Kostiantynivka area, according to Kastehelmi.

Russia has held the initiative on the battlefield in the Donetsk Oblast since the fall of 2023, after Ukraine's failed summer counteroffensive.

The recent Russian push comes as the U.S. continues to insist on peace talks between Russia and Ukraine to end the war at all costs. U.S. President Donald Trump and his team have made numerous threats that Washington could walk away from the peace process if there is no progress made in the near future, putting U.S. military support and intelligence sharing with Ukraine on the line.

The experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said that the current Russian push in Donetsk Oblast is setting the stage for a major upcoming offensive.

""I think that this is a development that will continue to be a growing issue for Ukraine during the summer because, as far as I know, the Russians should have relatively large reserves that they can commit to the battle in the coming weeks and months,"" Kastehelmi said.

Ukraine had largely stabilized the situation on the eastern front earlier this year after Russia ramped up the offensive tempo in the summer of 2024, likely taking advantage of multiple elite Ukrainian units being deployed to Russia's Kursk Oblast for a surprise cross-border incursion.

One such unit, the 80th Air Assault Brigade, had manned the defense near Klishchiivka, a village south of Chasiv Yar and north of Toretsk that Ukraine liberated in 2023.

""Whilst the offensive is still underway, they're probably building momentum for higher tempo and more intense offensive operations in the coming months.""

Factors such as Ukraine's manpower shortage and the combat capabilities of the Ukrainian units deployed in the area would dictate how Ukrainian troops will hold onto the pocket south of Kostiantynivka, according to Kastehelmi. The lack of well-trained troops remains the army's weakest spot, with Ukraine struggling to recruit new soldiers and train them to prepare for the brutal reality of the war, experts and officers say.

Ukrainian monitoring group DeepState said in April that Russian troops were preparing to advance in an area southwest of Toretsk by solidifying their presence in the village of Kalynove down south.

The question hangs over the combat capabilities of the Ukrainian units deployed in the area, as reinforcing the area with units that aren't battered after fighting in hot spots of the war, such as Kursk Oblast, would be a challenge, according to Kastehelmi.

""The Ukrainians need to make some difficult decisions on what directions they can prioritize and what reserves they can commit,"" the expert said.

Retired Australian Army Major-General Mick Ryan, who has closely observed the war in Ukraine, said that even if Ukraine were to lose the pocket south of Kostiantynivka, he doesn't believe that it would bring ""any significant shift in the trajectory of the war at this point.""

While it is still ""a significant bit of territory,"" the more pressing concern is for Russia not to gain momentum after potentially conquering it, according to Ryan.

""The last thing you want is for the Russians to become more confident and think they can generate additional momentum because they take this area,"" Ryan told the Kyiv Independent.

The Australian expert said that Russia is adapting its tactics on the front line, for example, increasingly using fiber optic and first-person-view (FPV) drones, enabling Russian troops to achieve better results.

""Whilst the offensive is still underway, they're probably building momentum for higher tempo and more intense offensive operations in the coming months,"" Ryan said.

For now, the question is whether Ukraine would make the timely decision to withdraw from the pocket, rather than holding onto unfavorable positions at a heavy cost, according to Kastehelmi from the Black Bird Group.

Ukrainian soldiers who spoke to the Kyiv Independent often criticized their command to ""hold until the end,"" even if the positions would soon be overrun by Russian troops and the Ukrainians would be left without proper evacuation or orderly withdrawal.

""This summer and the next fall will look really difficult,"" Kastehelmi said.

The European Union is weighing a proposal to disconnect more than 20 Russian banks from SWIFT, the global financial messaging network, as part of its upcoming 18th sanctions package against Moscow, Bloomberg reported on May 24, citing undisclosed sources.

The discussions come as the EU agreed on the bloc's 17th package of sanctions against Russia on May 20, primarily targeting the Russian shadow fleet of oil tankers. Though hailed in Brussels as a sign of continued resolve, the package has drawn criticism, including from some EU insiders, who said it was a diluted step that falls short of the urgency required.

The new measures under consideration would also include lowering the Group of Seven (G7) oil price cap on Russian crude exports from $60 to around $45 per barrel, banning the Nord Stream gas pipelines, and imposing approximately 2.5 billion euros ($2.84 billion) in new trade restrictions, Bloomberg reported.

The proposals are currently being reviewed by the European Commission in consultation with member states. EU sanctions require unanimous approval from all 27 nations, and details of the package could still change before formal adoption.

The move aims to further cut Russia's revenue streams and limit its access to Western technologies critical for weapons production. The proposed reduction in the oil price cap, a key feature of the G7's coordinated sanctions effort, would need support from the United States, which has so far held off on additional sanctions under President Donald Trump, despite repeated threats.

The New York Times reported on May 20 that Trump has refused to impose additional sanctions on Russia, citing concerns that they could jeopardize future business and trade opportunities with Moscow.

Following a two-hour call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump said sanctions could ""make it much worse,"" though he did not rule them out entirely.

Germany has already signaled its backing for the ban on the Nord Stream pipelines, with German government spokesperson Stefan Cornelius confirming that the EU is coordinating its actions with the U.S.

Nord Stream 1 and 2 are gas pipelines running between Russia and Germany under the Baltic Sea. Nord Stream 2 was never activated, and the pipes shut down after suspected sabotage in 2022.

The sanctions would aim to prevent any potential revival of the project amid ongoing calls for peace negotiations.

According to Bloomberg, the EU is also preparing to broaden its restrictions on Russia’s so-called shadow fleet of oil tankers, expand bans on banks aiding the Kremlin’s war efforts, and target the Russian Direct Investment Fund.

The European Commission is also reportedly pushing to include provisions shielding European companies from arbitration claims under bilateral investment treaties affected by the sanctions.

The proposed measures come amid renewed international efforts to broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. While Trump has called for direct peace talks, Russia continues to reject a U.S.-backed 30-day ceasefire proposal.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2154602469.jpg

Claims that Russian troops have entered the village of Yunakivka in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy Oblast are false, Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne reported on May 24, citing the Ukrainian Kursk military command.

Earlier, Russia's state-run news agency TASS claimed that Russian forces had entered Yunakivka, a village near the Russian border in Sumy Oblast. Ukrainian officials refuted the claim in comments for Suspilne, saying that no Russian presence had been established in the settlement.

According to DeepState, an open-source monitoring group, several villages in the region, including Novenke, Zhuravka, Veselivka, and Basivka, remain in the so-called ""gray zone,"" areas with ongoing or unclear military control.

The gray zone reportedly expanded toward Vodolahy and Bilovody between May 12 and 13, villages in the Khotin community west of the city of Sumy.

Sumy Oblast, which borders Russia to the north, has been a repeated target of Russian incursions and shelling since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. The region has recently seen renewed hostilities as Russian forces ramp up activity along the northeastern border.

Nearly 56,000 residents have been evacuated from Sumy Oblast as of May 19, with over 86,000 people currently under mandatory evacuation orders. Approximately 65% of the targeted population has already left the region, including 2,400 residents evacuated in the past week.

Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) has documented more than 150 cases of Ukrainian soldiers being summarily executed after surrendering to Russian forces, the agency said on May 24.

The agency noted that this figure includes those cases recorded by HUR, suggesting the actual total may be higher. The statement came as Kyiv and Moscow began their largest prisoner exchange of the full-scale war.

There has been a sharp rise in executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) by Russian forces since 2024.

Intelligence officials have cited multiple instances in which Russian troops received direct orders to kill prisoners of war. According to HUR, these acts are not isolated incidents but part of a deliberate and systematic policy of the Russian leadership.

This pattern of war crimes has also been confirmed by the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine. In a report released on March 19, the commission found a growing number of cases in which Russian forces deliberately killed or maimed Ukrainian soldiers who had surrendered or attempted to surrender.

""Several (Russian deserters) told the commission that they had received orders not to take prisoners but kill them instead,"" the U.N. report read. One described a deputy brigade commander saying, ""Prisoners are not needed, shoot them on the spot.""

In February, the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine raised alarm over a sharp increase in executions of Ukrainian POWs by Russian forces, documenting 79 POW executions across 24 separate incidents since late August 2024, some involving group killings.

The U.N. findings, based on witness testimony and verified media content, describe Ukrainian POWs, including unarmed or wounded soldiers, being shot on the spot, often in areas of active Russian military operations.

British security officials are investigating potential Russian involvement in a series of arson attacks on properties linked to U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the Financial Times reported on May 23, citing senior U.K. government sources.

Three separate incidents occurred earlier this month, targeting Starmer's family home in Kentish Town, north London, a car, and a former residence.

Two Ukrainian nationals, Roman Lavrynovych and Petro Pochynok, and a Romanian national, Stanislav Carpiuc, have been charged with conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life.

Prosecutors allege the men acted in cooperation with other unknown suspects. All three are in custody and are scheduled to appear in court on June 6, the Financial Times reports.

According to senior officials, U.K. investigators are examining whether Russian actors may have recruited the suspects. Authorities are reportedly assessing potential responses should evidence of Russian involvement emerge.

The British counter-terrorist police and prosecutors said the exact motive remains unclear, the Financial Times reported.

Western intelligence officials have warned about increasing Russian sabotage operations across Europe. Arson attacks have previously targeted other EU countries, raising suspicions of a coordinated Russian effort to destabilize the countries that support Ukraine against Russian aggression.

Recently, German authorities have accused three Ukrainian nationals of an alleged Russia-orchestrated plot of aggravated arson and bombing attacks on behalf of Russian authorities.

Poland also accused two other Ukrainian nationals of being involved in suspected arson attacks believed to be backed by Russia.

The Energia facility, which lies in the Lipetsk Oblast city of Yelets, was attacked for the second night in a row, with residents reporting at least five explosions overnight, Astra reported.

Governor Igor Artamonov confirmed that drone wreckage fell in the city's industrial district, adding there were no casualties. The extent of damage to the plant is not immediately clear.

The city of Yelets lies some 250 kilometers (150 miles) north of the Russia-Ukraine border.

The Ukrainian military confirmed an earlier attack against the sanctioned facility on May 23, noting that the plant is Russia's ""only manufacturer of batteries for glide and correction modules installed on aircraft bombs,"" and also produces parts for ballistic and cruise missiles.

In Tula Oblast, the Azot chemical plant in Novomoskovsk came under a drone strike, starting a fire, Astra reported. The channel shared footage of what appears to be smoke rising from the targeted facility.

The Azot company specializes in the production of ammonia and nitrogen fertilizers, as well as organic plastics, resins, chlorine, nitric acid, and more, according to open sources.

Dmitry Milyaev, the governor of Tula Oblast, confirmed an overnight drone attack, saying that a fire at a gas pipeline in Novomoskovsk was extinguished and three people were injured. The city lies some 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of the Russia-Ukraine border.

As part of a broader policy realignment, this office would be merged into the Pentagon's Europe and NATO office, reducing its prominence despite its critical role since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

While no staff cuts are currently planned, the restructuring would mark a demotion for an office that helped coordinate the delivery of over $130 billion in security aid to Ukraine, roughly half of which came from the United States.

Under former director Laura Cooper, the office also played a key role in organizing a coalition of 50 countries that has met 27 times to support Ukraine. Cooper left her role in December, and the office is now led by an acting official.

The office and its Europe and NATO counterpart both report to the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, a role currently held by an acting official as nominee Daniel Zimmerman awaits Senate confirmation. Sources say the decision is not final, but multiple former officials view the shift as part of a larger pivot away from Ukraine under President Trump’s second term.

Current Pentagon policy chief Elbridge Colby has advocated for reducing U.S. military assistance to Ukraine to prioritize deterrence efforts in Asia.

During a February visit to NATO headquarters, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth emphasized that European allies should take on greater responsibility for continental security, including Ukraine. ""Leaders of our European allies should take primary responsibility for defense of the continent,"" Hegseth said.

Former U.S. officials have raised concerns that combining the offices would create an unmanageable workload for the director. David Baker, who now leads the Europe and NATO office, is reportedly fielding high interest from European governments seeking clarity ahead of the June NATO summit.

""It will be very hard for a single DASD to handle that many important [and] high maintenance countries,"" one former official told Defense News. Meanwhile, although intelligence sharing and previously scheduled aid to Ukraine continue, new funding has stalled.

Major Russian exporters are cutting back shipments of metals and oil products by rail, signaling weakening demand and a slowdown in the country’s war-driven economy.

A document seen by Reuters reveals that firms such as Rusal and Gazpromneft intend to reduce the volumes they plan to move by rail in 2025, prompting Russian Railways to slash spending by an additional 32.5 billion rubles ($408 million). That brings the state rail monopoly’s planned investment for 2025 to 858.4 billion rubles—down about 3.5% from earlier projections.

Russian Railways had already planned to reduce investment this year by 40% compared to 2024, citing rising interest payment costs.

Cargo volumes — which fell to a 15-year low in 2024 — serve as a key indicator of the overall health of Russia’s export-driven manufacturing sector, according to Reuters as the outlet reviewed the internal presentation to the railway’s board by First Deputy CEO Vadim Mikhaylov, who explained the revised spending plan and highlighted five external reasons for the cuts.

The revised cargo forecast shows Russian Railways expects to transport 36.7 million metric tons less than the previously projected 1.24 billion tons in 2025. Although full-year volume is still projected to exceed 2024’s total of 1.18 billion tons, cargo transport fell 6.8% year-on-year between January and April.

Among the companies scaling back shipments are aluminium producer Rusal and steel manufacturers Severstal, MMK, TMK, NLMK, and Evraz. ""High rates have also led steel producers to reduce loading volumes,"" the document reportedly said.

Tight monetary policy has compounded the sector’s challenges. The Bank of Russia has kept its key interest rate at 21% since October, dampening construction activity and hitting demand for steel. ""Steel production, exports and local demand dropped in 2024,"" the World Steel Association reported, and that decline has continued into 2025, according to Chermet Corporation.

The railway operator also cited reduced demand in other sectors, including from Rusal. The company confirmed it is sticking to plans made in November, which included cutting annual aluminium output by 250,000 tons due to high alumina costs.

Sanctions against metals, forestry, and oil companies like Gazpromneft, Surgutneftegaz, and Tatneft are also weighing on rail cargo. Exports of wood, fertilizer, and metals to China have dropped, with overall trade turnover between the two countries down 7.5% this year. The document adds that ""the interference of third parties mainly in relation to oil refineries""—a veiled reference to Ukrainian drone attacks—has further disrupted shipments.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/04/GettyImages-1242919634.jpg

The EU is close to restricting the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in a new round of sanctions as Russia refuses a ceasefire in its war against Ukraine, Bloomberg reported on May 23.

""It is a political move, aimed at cementing the EU’s plan to phase out Russian gas imports by 2027,"" Florence Schmit, an energy strategist in London, told Bloomberg.

The decision to sanction the non-operational Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline will take into account progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter.

Russia has refused a ceasefire with Ukraine, and peace talks between the two nations in Istanbul on May 16 were largely inconclusive. Moscow has repeatedly signalled their unwillingness to move forward in peace negotiations.

Germany supports the newly proposed EU sanctions, which would target the Nord Stream pipelines, spokesperson Stefan Cornelius said on May 19.

""Political clarity should also start to quell some volatility in gas markets that was related to the on-and-off discussions about Russian gas supplies,"" Schmit told Bloomberg.

The European Commission will begin discussions with member states as early as May 23, unnamed sources familiar with the matter said.

German ""Chancellor (Friedrich) Merz is working with U.S. and European partners on new sanctions against Russia... the intention of these sanctions is to achieve agreement from Russia to an unconditional truce,"" Cornelius told German outlet, Tagesshau.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed on March 26 that talks were ongoing between the U.S. and the EU to resume flows of gas in the Nord Stream pipelines.

Lavrov on May 21 confirmed that Moscow has no interest in negotiations and agreeing to a ceasefire in Ukraine, saying, ""We don't want this anymore.""

At the Istanbul peace talks, Moscow reiterated maximalist demands, including that Ukraine accept the loss of Crimea and four eastern regions.

Two Russian military aircraft are suspected of violating Finland's airspace, the country's defense ministry reported on May 23.

""We take the suspected territorial violation seriously and an investigation is underway,"" Finnish Defense Minister Antti Hakkanen said in a statement. The Finnish border guard is investigating and will share more information as the probe continues, according to the Finnish Defense Ministry.

Russia regularly stages provocations on NATO's eastern flank, which includes Poland, Finland, and the Baltic countries. On May 22, Polish fighter jets intercepted a Russian Su-24 bomber in international airspace over the Baltic Sea.

Russian aircraft frequently fly from its exclave, Kaliningrad. The jets often disable their transponders, fail to file flight plans, and do not establish contact with regional air traffic control—a pattern NATO officials describe as high-risk behavior.

Finland expects an increased Russian military buildup on its border once the war against Ukraine is over, Major General Sami Nurmi, the head of strategy of the Finnish defense forces, said.

The Russian military has begun ""moderate preparations when it comes to building infrastructure"" close to the Finnish border, Nurmi added.

""We have excellent capabilities to observe Russian operations. As a member of the alliance, Finland holds a strong security position,"" Hakkanen said in a separate statement on May 22.

Finland joined NATO in 2023 following the onset of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine in February 2022 and shares a 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) border with Russia.

Ukraine would like U.S. President Donald Trump to be present at a potential meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha told reporters on May 23, according to Ukrinform.

""We are also working on... a meeting between President Zelensky and Putin. We admit that this meeting may be in an expanded format. We would very much like President Trump to join it,"" Sybiha said.

The foreign minister noted the continuation of peace talks must be unconditional, adding that ""we are waiting for the Russian side to present their vision, their concept, their proposals on the parameters of a future unconditional ceasefire."" Kyiv is also working on a peace proposal of its own to share with Moscow, Sybiha added.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia would only submit the draft ""settlement document"" after the ongoing prisoner exchange is completed.

On May 23, Ukraine and Russia began a previously agreed prisoner exchange — the largest swap since Russia launched its war against Ukraine in 2014. A total of 1,000 prisoners from both sides are expected to return home between May 23 and 25. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that 390 Ukrainians were brought back as part of the exchange on the first day.

The prisoner exchange came as diplomatic efforts to end the war regained momentum and Ukraine has ""always consistently insisted that Europe must be at the table of possible future negotiations,"" Sybiha said.

Editor's note: The article incorrectly said that only soldiers were brought back to Ukraine as part of the exchange. Ukraine has brought back home 290 soldiers and 120 civilians.

Their eyes fill with tears as they hear people shouting, ‘Thank you!’ and ‘Glory to Ukraine!’

The soldiers have just arrived in Ukraine after being exchanged in the largest prisoner swap to date since the start of Russia’s war against Ukraine in 2014.

Still overwhelmed, Ukrainian soldier Anton Kobylnyk tells the Kyiv Independent at the exchange site in Ukraine that he couldn’t believe he was really going home — ""not until I was back on Ukrainian soil,"" he said.

Over three days, from May 23-25, 1,000 prisoners from both sides will return home in a deal agreed upon during direct Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul earlier in May — the first such talks between Moscow and Kyiv since 2022. A total of 390 people were brought back to Ukraine as part of the exchange on May 23, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

Russia's Defense Ministry said that 270 soldiers and 120 civilians had returned to Russia in this first swap. In turn, 270 Ukrainian soldiers and 120 civilians were brought back home to Ukraine.

Kobylnyk said he had been in Russian captivity for over three years since April 12, 2022, captured at the Azovmash plant in Mariupol during Russia’s brutal months-long siege of the city. The worst part, he said, was the psychological strain — though the physical toll was also heavy.

Originally from Pavlohrad, in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, the first thing he tried to do when he arrived in Ukraine was call his mother.

When she finally answered, she was crying and shouting. ""It’s okay, Mom, I’m home. The most important thing is that I’m in Ukraine.""

The Ukrainian and Russian governments confirmed they had received the lists of POWs to be exchanged on May 22.

Zelensky announced on the same day that he held a meeting to prepare the exchange and called the agreement on the POW swap the only ""real"" result of the meeting between the two delegations in Istanbul.

""The agreement on the release of 1,000 of our people from Russian captivity was almost the only real result of the meeting in Turkey. We are working to ensure this result. We are finding out the details of each person listed on the Russian side,"" Zelensky said.

As the lists of who will be exchanged are not made public, family members who hope for the return of their loved ones from captivity arrived at the exchange site expecting good news.

Mariia Barkova, who has been waiting for her brother, a marine, to return from Russian captivity for four years, said she never misses a single exchange, and the news that this one would be the largest in history gave her new hope.

""When my friend’s son was exchanged, I got more hope. I believed it was possible to wait for the exchange to occur soon,"" Barkova said.

Barkova added that their parents live under Russian occupation and are awaiting their son’s exchange.

""His brother is also waiting for him. He is a cancer patient,"" Barkova said.

Inna Sokurina is also waiting for the return of a close family member — her son, a marine, who has been in Russian captivity for 37 months.

""We don’t know if he will be in the exchange, but we hope he will be. After all, today is Marine Corps Day (May 23),”""Sokurina said.

Sokurina added that she came to the exchange for the first time because of its scale. ""This is a large-scale exchange, 1,000 people. We decided that this could be a sign,"" she said.

As the soldiers arrive where the family members are waiting, the family members shout out their names, hoping to find them, or at least get some information about them from the other freed prisoners.

""No, I’m sorry, I haven’t seen him. And even if I did… he might have changed so much, I wouldn’t recognize him,"" says Ukrainian soldier Kostiantyn, who declined to give his last name.

Kostiantyn’s hands tremble as he holds photos of those still in captivity, given to him by their relatives. After spending 21 months in Russian captivity, he speaks little of his experience — his voice marked by both sadness and gratitude to be home.

He didn’t have anyone meet him at the exchange site, but he plans to reconnect with his family soon. ""I haven’t called my relatives yet. They’re not here,"" he says quietly. ""I’ll call them later, once I figure everything out.""

As he makes his way toward a clinic for a medical exam, someone shows him a photo. ""I’m sorry,"" he says, ""I really don’t know him…""

According to the President's Office chief Andriy Yermak, diplomatic representatives of the Nordic and Baltic countries also participated in preparations for the swap. He added that after the 1,000-for-1,000 exchange is completed, future direct talks with Russian officials could be arranged.

At least 8,000 Ukrainian service members are held captive by Russia, Iryna Vereshchuk, Presidential Office deputy head, said on May 1, citing data from Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of POWs.

Kyiv does not release the figures for how many Russian POWs are currently in Ukrainian custody.

While ceasefire agreements and peace talks have remained elusive since the start of the full-scale invasion, regular prisoner swaps have remained one of the few areas of ongoing cooperation between the two countries.

Ukraine has long advocated for an ""all-for-all"" exchange, but Russia has so far rejected the proposal.

On May 20, the head of the Ukrainian National Union of Journalists, Serhii Tomilenko, handed over a list of Ukrainian media workers held in Russian captivity to the Vatican's ambassador to Ukraine, Visvaldas Kulbokas. According to the union, at least 31 Ukrainian journalists are being illegally detained by Russia.

Russia has a common practice of sentencing captured Ukrainian journalists to long prison terms on fabricated charges and holding them captive in harsh conditions under physical and psychological pressure, which in most cases amounts to torture, Yurii Vitrenko, a permanent representative of Ukraine to international organizations in Vienna, said on April 10 during a regular meeting of the OSCE Permanent Council.

Russian forces have also killed 103 media workers during the full-scale invasion, according to Ukraine's Culture Ministry.

Among those killed was Ukrainian journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna, whose body Ukraine brought back in April. Roshchyna's body showed signs of torture and was missing some internal organs, which may have been deliberately removed to obscure signs of suffocation or strangulation, according to an investigation by the Forbidden Stories journalism network.

Russia is also illegally detaining at least 16,000 Ukrainian civilians, of whom only 174 have returned , according to Ukrainian Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets.



Lubinets stressed that a country that occupies the territory of another has no right to detain civilians, according to the Geneva Conventions. ""Unfortunately, international humanitarian law does not answer the question of how to respond if Russia continues this illegal practice,"" he added.

Another area of Ukraine's efforts to bring back its citizens is related to the return of Ukrainian children.

Over 19,500 children have been forcibly deported to Russia, Belarus, or the occupied territories, according to government data. So far, only about 1,300 of them have been safely brought to Ukrainian government-controlled territory.

Ukrainian children forcibly taken to Russia or Russian-occupied territories are placed in families or Russian camps, where they are known to be subjected to intense anti-Ukrainian propaganda, and at times, military training.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has also taken up the matter. In March 2023, it issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Children's Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova over their involvement in abductions.

On May 8, the European Parliament overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning Russia's forcible deportation and Russification of Ukrainian children, calling it a ""genocidal strategy"" aimed at erasing Ukrainian identity and demanding the unconditional return of all abducted minors.

The European Union has agreed to reintroduce import quotas on several Ukrainian agricultural products starting June 6, Bloomberg reported on May 23.

The move marks a significant shift in EU trade policy toward Kyiv, as bloc members seek to balance wartime support for Ukraine with growing domestic unrest from European farmers.

The quotas were eliminated at the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.

Their reintroduction was approved by the European Commission on May 22. While no EU member voted against the new measure, several — including Sweden, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, and Lithuania — abstained.

The decision comes after protests across Central and Eastern Europe, where farmers argued that the influx of lower-cost Ukrainian goods has depressed local prices and undermined their livelihoods.

Polish farmers and truckers in particular have staged repeated blockades at the Ukrainian border since 2023 to protest duty-free imports.

Agricultural exports are critical to Ukraine's wartime economy, and EU market access has served as a lifeline following Russia's 2022 invasion, which severely disrupted Black Sea shipping lanes.

In response, the EU introduced a duty- and quota-free regime in June 2022 to ease the flow of Ukrainian goods to global markets. The agreement has been extended twice, most recently until June 5.

The European Commission said the quotas are temporary and that talks are underway to revise the EU-Ukraine Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), the broader legal framework governing bilateral trade.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1242186203.jpg

Ukraine and the United States have officially launched a joint Reconstruction Investment Fund as part of their minerals agreement, Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko announced on May 23.

""The last step was a diplomatic note from the United States, which I personally received this morning from Julie S. Davis, the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires. The Fund is officially launched,"" Svyrydenko wrote in a Facebook post.

The fund is a core component of the broader U.S.-Ukraine minerals agreement, signed on April 30.

Under the deal, the U.S. has special access to projects involving Ukraine's reserves of lithium, titanium, and other critical minerals. These resources are considered critical to global supply chains for the defense, aerospace, and green energy industries.

The fund will be jointly managed by Ukraine's Public-Private Partnerships Agency and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC).

While both sides have declined to disclose full operational details, officials have framed the project as a vehicle for long-term reconstruction and foreign investment.

The agreement has been months in the making, following a contentious negotiation process that at times strained bilateral ties. The final version removed controversial provisions that Ukrainian officials and experts feared could lead to exploitation of Ukraine's mineral wealth.

Two additional agreements to operationalize the fund were signed on May 13. President Volodymyr Zelensky signed the ratified minerals agreement on May 12.

Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on April 27 that future U.S. military assistance may be counted as part of the fund's resources, although past aid will not be included.

Andriy Portnov, a former top official in ex-President Viktor Yanukovych's administration, visited Ukraine just days before he was shot dead in Madrid on May 21, the news outlet Ukrainska Pravda reported on May 23, citing unnamed sources.

According to three interlocutors with knowledge of Portnov's movements — including sources in law enforcement and his inner circle — he was in Ukraine on May 17-18 and reportedly met with top law enforcement officials.

Portnov, a lawyer and longtime political operative, was shot at least five times outside the American School in Madrid. Two or three individuals are believed to have taken part in the killing.

Citing police sources, El Pais reported that Portnov was hit by at least three bullets, including one to the head, which proved fatal. No arrests have been reported so far.

The killing comes amid resurfacing scrutiny of Portnov's activities in Ukraine, particularly his alleged ties to the judiciary and law enforcement.

Portnov was Yanukovych's deputy chief of staff responsible for the judiciary and head of his administration's legal department. Even after Yanukovych was overthrown during the 2014 EuroMaidan Revolution, Portnov reportedly retained significant influence over the judiciary.

He fled Ukraine after the EuroMaidan Revolution, first relocating to Russia and later to Austria. He returned to Ukraine in 2019, but left again in 2022 following Russia's full-scale invasion — reportedly skirting the wartime travel ban for military-age men.

In 2021, the U.S. sanctioned Portnov for suspected corruption, accusing him of using influence over Ukraine's judicial system to secure favorable rulings and amass wealth.

Portnov was also widely regarded as one of the most litigious figures among Ukraine's ex-officials.

In 2024, a Kyiv court ruled in his favor in a defamation suit against several outlets, including the Kyiv Independent, over references to him as ""pro-Russian."" The contested article was authored by Glib Kanievskyi, now a defense ministry official.

Ukraine and Russia on May 23 began the largest exchange of prisoners of war (POWs) since the start of Russia's war in 2014, a Kyiv Independent journalist reported from the site of the swap.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Telegram that 390 Ukrainian prisoners had been exchanged as part of the first stage of the swap.

""We are bringing our people home. The first stage of the '1000-for-1000' exchange agreement has been carried out,"" Zelensky wrote. ""Today – 390 people. On Saturday and Sunday, we expect the exchange to continue.""

Russia's Defense Ministry said that 270 soldiers and 120 civilians had returned to Russia as part of the first stage.

The exchange will see 1,000 POWs from both sides return home, in a deal agreed upon during direct talks in Istanbul on May 16, the first such talks between Moscow and Kyiv since 2022.

""I thank everyone who is helping and working 24/7 to bring Ukrainian men and women back home. It is very important to return everyone who remains in captivity,"" Zelensky added.

Ukraine confirms strike on Russian factory making parts for ballistic missiles

Ukraine has confirmed a strike on an industrial zone in the city of Yelets in Russia's Lipetsk Oblast overnight on May 23, that hit a factory making parts for Russian weapons, including Iskander ballistic missiles.

""The target was hit... and a series of explosions were recorded,"" Ukraine's General Staff said in a post on social media, adding: ""A fire broke out on the territory of the facility.""

It said the factory, which is under U.S. and EU sanctions, is Russia's ""only manufacturer of batteries for glide and correction modules installed on aircraft bombs,"" and also produces parts for ballistic and cruise missiles.

""The shutdown of the Energia public company may leave some of the Russian occupiers' military equipment and weapons without critical batteries,"" the General Staff said.

The extent of the damage to the factory was still being assessed, it added.

The General Staff did not specify what type of weapon was used in the attack, but earlier on May 23, Lipetsk Oblast Governor Igor Artamonov said Ukrainian drones were behind the attack.

Videos on social media purported to show blasts and fires following the strikes.

Artamonov said that drone debris fell on a residential building in Yelets, injuring eight people.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the reports.

Ukraine regularly launches drone attacks against Russian military and industrial facilities in the rear to undermine Russia's ability to wage its all-out war.

In recent weeks, Kyiv has stepped up its drone attacks on Russia, sending hundreds of drones flying toward Moscow. While no direct hits have been reported, the attacks have caused temporary closures of multiple airports.

According to Russia's Defense Ministry, Russian air defenses have downed 112 Ukrainian drones overnight on May 23, including 24 over Moscow and one over Lipetsk Oblast.

Zelensky slams Russia's delay on peace memorandum as 'mockery of the whole world'

Russia's weeklong delay in preparing a proposal on a peace settlement is a ""mockery of the whole world,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on May 23.

The remarks come after Russian President Vladimir Putin, during a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump on May 19, refused to support a full ceasefire in Ukraine. Instead, the Kremlin proposed drafting a ""memorandum"" on a possible future peace settlement.

Zelensky said that, while Ukraine and its partners are working toward an immediate ceasefire, Russia is stalling.

""When it took the Russians a week to formulate the so-called 'memorandum' in response to the demand for a ceasefire, it is definitely a mockery of the whole world,"" Zelensky said.

""We need a ceasefire. We need diplomatic steps toward real peace. And it's definitely time to put more pressure on Russia.""

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on May 20 that there was ""no timeline"" for completing the document, according to Russian state media TASS.

Three days later, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia would only submit the draft ""settlement document"" after the ongoing prisoner exchange is completed.

That exchange, agreed during direct Ukraine-Russia talks in Istanbul on May 16, saw both sides begin returning 1,000 prisoners of war (POWs) on May 23. It marks the largest such swap since Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014 and is the only concrete outcome of the Istanbul talks so far.

Zelensky said Moscow continues to block any meaningful progress beyond the prisoner swap.

""Every day in the war is a loss of life. Of course, in Russia, they don't count people. But the world must count,"" he said. ""New sanctions against Russia are needed. I thank each and every one of you who advocate and support this.""

Russian military helicopter crashes in Oryol Oblast

A Russian Mi-8 combat helicopter crashed near the village of Naryshkino in Russia's Oryol Oblast on May 23, killing the crew, the state-controlled news agency TASS reported, citing the Russian army's Moscow Military District.

The Russian Telegram channel Baza published a video that purportedly shows smoke rising after the helicopter crash, followed by additional explosions.

The Moscow Military District attributed the crash to a technical malfunction.

The Mi-8 is a Soviet-era aircraft most commonly used for transport by both the Russian military and civilian government agencies. It can also serve in combat and command roles.

There have been several cases of Russian helicopters and planes crashing during the full-scale war, sometimes resulting in fatalities.

Russia's aviation industry took a heavy hit as a result of Western sanctions, often lacking the necessary components to maintain the aircraft.

Russia executes 2 Ukrainian POWs near Pokrovsk, prosecutors say

Russian forces have executed two Ukrainian prisoners of war during an assault near the village of Udachne, 12 kilometers (7 miles) west of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office reported on May 23.

According to the prosecutors, the incident occurred on May 22 during an attack on Ukrainian positions in one of the most active combat zones of the front line.

Russian troops reportedly took two of four Ukrainian soldiers prisoner during the assault and later shot them dead with automatic weapons in a nearby forest. The fate of the other two soldiers remains unknown.

""The deliberate killing of prisoners of war is a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions and is qualified as a serious international crime,"" the Prosecutor General's Office said in a statement.

Ukraine's military and law enforcement agencies have launched an investigation to identify those responsible.

The execution of prisoners of war (POWs) follows a documented pattern of war crimes committed by Russian forces. As of mid-December 2024, Ukrainian authorities recorded the execution of 177 Ukrainian soldiers after capture.

Visual evidence and forensic records have backed repeated claims by Kyiv that Moscow systematically violates international humanitarian law by targeting unarmed soldiers and civilians.

The Geneva Conventions classify summary executions of detainees as grave breaches of international humanitarian law.

The nature, size, and political significance of prisoner exchanges between Ukraine and Russia have evolved significantly over the three and a half years of the full-scale war, accelerating sharply in recent weeks.

While ceasefire and peace negotiations have gone through periods of halts and bursts, increasingly institutionalized prisoner exchanges are one of the few enduring areas of direct cooperation between Ukraine and the Russian Federation.

On average, Ukraine and Russia exchanged 135 prisoners — mostly military, but with a sizable civilian component – each month from February 2022 through May 2025 (excluding the planned 1,000 for 1,000 exchange that began on May 23). But a deeper inspection of the data reveals a number of meaningful trends.

Prisoner exchange numbers have surged — 277 individuals changed hands in April, and this weekend alone, 1,000 brave Ukrainians will come home. The picture is unrecognizable from last year, when prisoners were only returned on special occasions and holidays. Prisoner exchanges have been shaped by competing (and sometimes mutually exclusive) priorities including backchannel logistics, battlefield developments, and geopolitics. New data collected by KI Insights, an analytical research unit backed by the Kyiv Independent, gives a look behind the curtain into the institutionalization of prisoner exchanges.

The full-scale invasion brought two meaningful institutional changes to prisoner exchanges. Firstly, Russia became an official party to the conflict, creating room to directly engage in negotiations. (Before the full-scale invasion, the Russian Federation denied its involvement in aggression in Ukraine, and negotiations were done through Russian-backed proxies in occupied Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.)

Secondly, Ukraine created the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, an interagency working group created by the Cabinet of Ministers in March of 2022, which is responsible for prisoner exchanges. Since its creation, the Coordination Headquarters has gone through meaningful changes. Roles and responsibilities have changed hands, priorities have been defined, and each agency has a specific process it is responsible for. Kyrylo Budanov, leader of the Coordination Headquarters (since June of 2022, taking over from Iryna Vereshchuk) and Ukraine’s chief of military intelligence, has successfully turned prisoner exchanges into an institution.

Data collected by KI Insights demonstrates the impact of institutionalization. The average number of prisoners swapped per exchange has steadily increased, growing by approximately 50% each year. The number of swaps, however, has been inconsistent, with frequent breakdowns until late last year. In 2022, an average of 50 prisoners were returned to Ukraine per exchange. In 2025, the number has risen to more than 200, with this weekend’s exchanges driving the number higher.

The Istanbul negotiations failed to achieve a ceasefire, proving once again, Russia does not want peace. But for the prisoners who returned home, they were meaningful. The exchange also underscores an interesting dynamic of this war. There are lines of communication between Ukraine and Russia, and enough trust between officials to work together to return prisoners home. That is significant — the current frontline in Ukraine is more than 1,200 kilometers long, and any ceasefire will require significant amounts of communication and trust between Ukrainian and Russian officials.

Russia has broken off prisoner exchanges at key points over the war, often when Russia thinks it can inflict maximum psychological damage. Following the siege of Mariupol and Ukraine’s unsuccessful counteroffensive, Russia froze prisoner exchanges. Russian soldiers also tortured and killed Ukrainian prisoners of war at Olenivka Prison and on the battlefield. Refusing to return prisoners is a tactic Russia uses to exploit existing divisions in Ukrainian society and exploit the pain of families of the imprisoned as a political resource.

For Russia, prisoners are resources — for psychological warfare and for bargaining. While pressure from the United States hasn’t brought Russia to the table for a ceasefire, it likely has caused Russian President Vladimir Putin to make a show of reasonableness by agreeing to a prisoner exchange.

The latest exchange is historic and could be a tipping point that helps U.S. President Donald Trump realize that U.S. pressure on Russia makes a difference. It could also solidify the shadowy infrastructure built between warring states and set the stage for an all-for-all prisoner exchange. Maybe it could, as Trump puts it, “lead to something big???” Even if it doesn’t, it is a battle won on the road to returning Ukrainians to Ukraine.

The end of the European Union’s tariff-free trade preferences for Ukrainian agricultural products is more than just a policy change, it’s a wake-up call.

For years, the EU has served as the largest and most reliable market for Ukraine’s agricultural exports. But as Brussels rolls back preferential quotas, Ukraine must rapidly diversify and open up new non-EU markets to safeguard its economy and cement its role in global food security.

Ukraine stands at a trading crossroads. It must now decide which path to go down as the European Union plans to apply much higher tariffs on agricultural and other exports as soon as next month.

The Breadbasket of Europe — and beyond

Ukraine has long been known as the breadbasket of Europe. Rich in black soil and abundant in agricultural know-how, the country is a global powerhouse in food production. Even under the shadow of war, after Russia’s invasion, the sector remains a cornerstone of the national economy.

Despite missile strikes, minefields, and logistical nightmares, Ukrainian farmers have kept working. Agricultural products account for 60% of all exports, bringing in an estimated $25 billion in earnings over the past year. The world depends on Ukrainian grain, oilseeds, and foodstuffs. Ukraine is the largest global exporter of sunflower oil, one of the biggest corn exporters, and a major supplier of wheat and barley. That strength must now be redirected toward a broader set of trading partners.

Ukraine doesn’t just offer grain, it offers food security.

Relying too heavily on any one market, especially one where political and economic headwinds can shift quickly, is risky. The EU’s new limits underscore the vulnerability of Ukraine’s agri-export model. To stay competitive, Ukraine must engage more vigorously with other countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and Asia, many of which face mounting food insecurity and would benefit greatly from stable Ukrainian supply lines.

Initiatives like the “Grain from Ukraine” program, providing for some of the poorest countries in Africa, have already shown the strategic value of Ukrainian agriculture. Citizens in Ethiopia, Sudan, Kenya, and many other countries have benefited. But these efforts must now expand from humanitarian aid to long-term commercial partnerships.

What Ukraine has to offer

Ukraine doesn’t just offer grain, it offers food security. As climate change and conflict disrupt food systems across the globe, Ukraine’s agricultural output can serve as a stabilizing force. The country’s ability to deliver large volumes of high-quality produce, often at competitive prices, makes it a natural partner for countries with growing populations and food import needs.

In addition to bulk commodities, Ukraine is increasingly competitive in higher-value products. The country exports hundreds of millions of dollars of organic goods to dozens of countries, despite the war. With growing global demand for sustainable, ethically produced food, Ukrainian agribusinesses are well-positioned to enter niche and premium markets if they get the right support.

The investment gap

Here’s the catch: Seizing these opportunities requires capital. Much of Ukraine’s agricultural infrastructure, storage facilities, railways, and processing plants need investment. Some have been damaged, degraded, or underdeveloped for decades. Logistics routes remain vulnerable. Certification standards and packaging often need to be upgraded to meet the demands of new markets.

Foreign direct investment (FDI) is critical to bridging this gap. Investors in agribusiness, logistics, technology, and processing can find long-term value in Ukraine’s vast agricultural potential. In return, their capital and expertise can help modernize the sector, unlock exports, and create jobs across the country.

Venture capital in agri-tech and climate-resilient farming, for instance, could help Ukrainian producers boost yields and diversify crops. Partnerships with multinational food companies could pave the way for Ukraine to move up the value chain — producing not just raw grain but ready-to-eat foodstuffs, sauces, baby food, and premium packaged goods.

This isn’t just about economics. It’s a matter of national security and global stability. A thriving agricultural sector boosts Ukraine’s GDP, stabilizes rural communities, and reduces dependence on international aid. It also enhances Ukraine’s geopolitical relevance by helping feed an increasingly hungry world.

Ukraine’s farmers have proven their grit. Now they need new markets and the investment to reach them. From North Africa to Southeast Asia, the demand is there. The quality is in Ukraine. What’s needed is the bridge, built through trade policy, diplomacy, and serious foreign investment.

Ukraine must sow the seeds now for a diversified, resilient, and prosperous agricultural future. And the world should be eager to help it grow.

Polish fighter jets intercepted a Russian Su-24 bomber in international airspace over the Baltic Sea on May 22, Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said during a press conference on May 23, according to the Polish news outlet RMF24.

The incident marks the latest in a series of Russian provocations near NATO territory. According to Kosiniak-Kamysz, the Russian aircraft posed a threat to regional airspace safety.

""These maneuvers performed by the Russian Su-24 show that the actions were dangerous and intentional,"" the minister said. He added that Polish pilots quickly detected, intercepted, and forced the bomber to withdraw from the area.

The encounter took place near the heavily militarized Kaliningrad Oblast, a Russian exclave wedged between Poland and Lithuania.

Russian aircraft often fly from Kaliningrad without using transponders, failing to file flight plans, and not establishing contact with regional air traffic control — a pattern that NATO officials have long described as high-risk behavior.

""We are resistant to provocations, but we react appropriately, individually and collectively,"" Kosiniak-Kamysz said, referring to NATO's air policing measures.

The intercepted aircraft, a Soviet-designed Su-24 bomber, is capable of carrying guided bombs and precision missiles and was developed for low-level penetration missions.

Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Poland has scrambled fighter jets multiple times in response to missile and drone attacks near its border.

On several occasions, Russian projectiles have briefly entered Polish airspace, prompting strong protests from Warsaw and increased NATO monitoring in the region.

On Feb. 11, a Russian Su-24MR reconnaissance aircraft flew into Polish airspace over the Gdansk Bay for over a minute. Moscow blamed a navigational failure, though Polish officials have dismissed similar explanations in the past as implausible.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Russia fired two ballistic missiles at Ukraine's southern port city of Odesa on May 23, killing two people and injuring seven others, Odesa Oblast Governor Oleh Kiper said.

Four of the wounded are in serious condition, he added.

The strike hit civilian infrastructure inside the port, damaging the engine room, shattering windows of nearby buildings, and destroying multiple pieces of equipment, according to Oleksiy Kuleba, minister for the development of communities, territories and infrastructure.

""It was a normal working day in a normal Ukrainian port,"" Kuleba wrote on Facebook.

""There was not a single military facility, only civilian infrastructure. Russia has once again attacked a peaceful, strategically important facility that is vital for the world's food security.""

Odesa, a key Black Sea port near the borders of Moldova and Romania, is critical for global trade and the export of Ukrainian grain.

Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukrainian ports have come under repeated fire, with Moscow targeting infrastructure essential to Ukraine's maritime operations.

Ukraine has confirmed a strike on an industrial zone in the city of Yelets in Russia's Lipetsk Oblast overnight on May 23, that hit a factory making parts for Russian weapons including Iskander ballistic missiles.

""The target was hit... and a series of explosions were recorded,"" Ukraine's General Staff said in a post on social media, adding: ""A fire broke out on the territory of the facility.""

Russia is now saying the quiet part out loud. It has no intention of stopping the war in Ukraine.



We in Ukraine knew this all along, of course, but to sate the demands of international diplomacy, Moscow and Washington have engaged in a now more than two-month-long peace process that has achieved nothing other than demonstrating that neither is willing to do what is necessary to achieve it.



Russia has apparently grown tired of its leading role in the charade and, emboldened by what is now the almost certain knowledge it will face no repercussions from the U.S. President Donald Trump, is openly bragging about having no interest in negotiations with Ukraine or a ceasefire.



""We don't want this anymore,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on May 21, confirming what his boss told Trump in a phone call two days earlier — that the Kremlin is not ready for peace in Ukraine because it believes it is winning the war.



Trump was furious at the news, apoplectic that Putin had been stringing him along and humiliating him all this time, swiftly imposing the long-threatened sanctions, as European leaders rallied together.



Oh, wait, sorry, this is what should have happened if there had been even an ounce of logic and decency left in this situation.



In reality, Trump barely shrugged, apparently content that he's keeping Russian money-making opportunities on the table, while the EU's latest sanctions are so ineffective it's been left up to Ukraine itself to explain to the bloc how it could maybe try and make them a bit tougher.

It's beginning to feel a bit like, despite all the rhetoric, the only player who truly wants the war to end is Ukraine.

Any notion of a peace process is effectively over, and there's only one remaining hope — those Americans who actually mean what they say and truly want the war to end must follow through and finally apply some good old-fashioned global superpower pressure on Russia.

Yes, U.S. senators, we're talking to you.

One way the war can end is if the U.S. makes Russia end it. Russia, and Russia alone, is responsible for the violence being inflicted in this war.

Russia's ceasefire proved the one thing that Putin couldn't admit at the time — that Russia and Russia alone is responsible for the violence being inflicted in this war.

Take a recent example — only two Ukrainian civilians were killed by Russian violence on May 8. Only two — that may sound cynical, and is in no way meant to detract from two tragedies, but the number is hugely significant.

The day before, on May 7, 14 people were killed and 54 others injured. In Kyiv on May 7, we spent the night in bomb shelters and hallways, listening to the sounds of ballistic missiles exploding, and attack drones flying overhead and crashing into people's homes.

Overnight on May 8, we slept uninterrupted throughout the night.

(Roman Pilipey / AFP via Getty Images)

What was the difference between these two days? On May 8, a three-day ceasefire unilaterally proposed by the Kremlin came into effect.

Now let's get one thing straight — the Kremlin's ceasefire was a sham, announced without consulting Ukraine, with the sole purpose of not embarrassing Russian President Vladimir Putin by forcing the cancellation of his Victory Day parade on May 9.

The Kremlin also violated it, and in addition to the two deaths noted above, Ukrainian soldiers told the Kyiv Independent that Russian forces were still active and attacking on the front lines.

But Russia suspended a major part of its military operations — aerial attacks against Ukrainian cities — and the immediate effect was a dramatic reduction in civilian deaths.

April was one of the deadliest months for civilians during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine — at least 209 civilians were killed, including 19 children, and 1,146 others were injured, all by Russian missiles, drones, and bombs.

Inadvertently, Russia's ceasefire proved the one thing that Putin wouldn’t admit — that Russia and Russia alone is responsible for the violence being inflicted in this war.

It is in Russia’s power to stop the war any moment, unilaterally, and to end the violence, as it showed with the ceasefire. But it won’t do it.

The same is true on the front lines.



Ukraine cannot end the fighting as long as Russia keeps attacking.

Where their armies clash, Ukraine, as the defending side, is reportedly responsible for the majority of the killing, as it’s conducting just and legal self-defense against Russian soldiers committing an unprovoked and illegal invasion of another sovereign nation.

For this killing to end, Russia can simply stop attacking. Aside from the personal humiliation of one man — Putin — Russia would suffer nothing, and lose nothing, from stopping the war.

Ukraine doesn’t have the same choice. It cannot end the fighting as long as Russia keeps attacking. It has everything to lose, and the violence its armed forces inflicts is committed in the name of survival, not conquest.

Even Ukrainian offensive operations like drone strikes into Russian territory are carried out in an attempt to deprive the Kremlin war machine of ammunition, fuel, and money, in an effort to aid Ukraine's survival.

This is the prism through which Washington should have viewed the U.S.-led peace process, but since Trump took office, the opposite has been true.

The U.S. has been applying pressure not on Russia, but on Ukraine, which has no choice other than to do what is required to survive.

In stark contrast, Russia remains unpunished by the Trump administration and is instead being wooed.

But there is still hope — the U.S.'s actions towards Russia are not solely in the hands of the president, and we know there are plenty of people on Capitol Hill who don't agree with the course that is currently being charted.

For one, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham's sanctions bill, the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, needs to be passed. Americans need to reach out to their representatives in Congress to demand that their elected officials support the bill.

German-based tech company Kontron exported sensitive technology to Russia via its Slovenian subsidiary, Kontron doo, despite a new round of EU sanctions, Politico reported on May 23.

According to the outlet, Kontron used the Slovenian entity to ship over 3.5 million euro ($3.9 million) worth of telecommunications equipment to its Russian subsidiary, Iskra Technologies, between July and November 2023.

The shipments included 11 deliveries and included the SI3000 telecommunications platform — a dual-use product capable of monitoring and intercepting communications.

The move appeared to circumvent multiple rounds of EU sanctions introduced in 2023 targeting dual-use and sensitive technologies, according to Politico.

Kontron said the exports were related to pre-sanction contracts and were authorized by Slovenian authorities under previously issued licenses. However, the media outlet reported that EU sanctions apply to all dual-use technology contracts, including those signed before the restrictions took effect.

Exceptions may exist, but only in specific cases such as cybersecurity, medical use, or emergencies — and only if authorized by the relevant national government.

Despite extensive Western sanctions aimed at cutting off supply lines, Russia continues to obtain sanctioned goods, such as microchips, via third-party countries.

Kyiv's allies have sought to halt the Kremlin's ability to circumvent sanctions.

Russian attacks against Ukraine killed seven people and injured 20 others over the past day, regional authorities said on May 23.

Ukrainian forces downed 91 out of the 175 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, and an Iskander-M ballistic missiles launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported.

Fifty-nine drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are usually decoys. Russia launches them alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine's air defense.

A Russian mass drone strike in Poltava Oblast destroyed the building of a business enterprise near Kremenchuk, injuring one person, Governor Volodymyr Kohut said. The attack also damaged power lines, leaving around 2,000 customers without power.

Two people were injured as a result of the Russian drone attack in Odesa Oblast, Governor Oleh Kiper reported.

Three people were killed in Kostiantynivka, Pokrovsk and Raihorodok in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Four more people were injured in the region over the past day.

A Russian guided bomb attack on Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast injured two 60-year-old employees of a local utility company, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. One of the men later died in hospital from injuries.

Finland is ""closely monitoring and assessing Russia’s activities and intentions"" near the Finnish border, the country's Defense Minister Antti Hakkanen told AFP on May 22.

The comments come after reports that Finland expects a Russian military build-up on its borders after the war in Ukraine ends.

Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, NATO officials have increasingly warned Moscow could attack the alliance's members in the coming years.

Finland shares a 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) border with Russia and joined NATO in 2023.

""We have excellent capabilities to observe Russian operations. As a member of the alliance, Finland holds a strong security position,"" Hakkanen said.

He also added that Russia’s actions aimed to strengthen its armed forces ""have not come as a surprise to Finland,"" but, at the same time, Finnish society ""has invested broadly in preparedness for all types of disruptions and crises.""

Major General Sami Nurmi, the head of strategy of the Finnish defense forces, said in an interview on May 21 that the Russian military has begun ""moderate preparations when it comes to building infrastructure"" close to Finnish borders.

Previously, on May 19, the New York Times published satellite images which seem to indicate an expansion of military facilities near the Finnish border.

The Finnish Border Guard announced the completion of the first 35 km (22 miles) of a planned 200 km fence along its eastern border with Russia on May 21.

The border has been closed for over a year after Helsinki accused Moscow of orchestrating a ""hybrid operation"" by directing asylum seekers toward Finland.

Finnish authorities claim that these hybrid tactics have intensified since the country joined NATO in 2023.

U.S. President Donald Trump, when asked about Russia’s recent actions on May 20, said that he had ""no concerns,"" assuring that Finland and Norway would remain ""very safe.""

""It doesn’t concern me at all. They’re totally safe. These are two countries that will be very safe,"" Trump said.

Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said last December that Russia must be ready for a potential conflict with NATO in the next 10 years.

Moscow has also issued a number of veiled and overt threats to the West over its support for Kyiv, including warnings of a possible nuclear response.

He sustained serious head injuries and was hospitalized.

The attack is reportedly connected to his professional activities, though the exact motives and circumstances remain under investigation. No suspect has been detained yet.

Ukraine cannot expect to return Russian-occupied territories as long as Moscow has the resources to continue its war, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., said on May 22.

Speaking via video at a forum in Kyiv, Zaluzhnyi said that Ukraine can only wage a ""high-tech war of survival"" using a minimum of human and economic resources.

""Ukraine is not capable of (fighting) another war in terms of demography and economy, and we shouldn’t even entertain the thought,"" the ambassador added.

According to Zaluzhnyi, the only way to win the war is to destroy Russia's military and economic potential to wage it.

""I hope there is no one left in this hall still waiting for a miracle — for some white swan to bring peace to Ukraine, restore the borders of 1991 or 2022, and after that there will be great happiness in Ukraine,"" Zaluzhnyi said.

He believes that as long as Russia has the resources, manpower, and capability to strike Ukrainian territory and launch offensives, it will continue to do so.

Ukraine's leadership has consistently vowed to restore the country's 1991 borders, which includes the liberation of Crimea and parts of the Donbas occupied by Russia since 2014.

After the failed 2023 counteroffensive and U.S.'s foreign policy shift this year, Kyiv adjusted its rhetoric. President Volodymyr Zelensky said this February that Russia has to pull back its troops to at least the front line as it was before the 2022 invasion.

Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed on May 22 that he ordered the military to begin creating a ""security buffer zone"" along the border with Ukraine, Russian state media outlets reported.

The comments come a day after Putin made his first known visit to Russia's Kursk Oblast, a border region where Ukrainian forces launched an incursion last summer. While the Kremlin claims to have fully liberated the territory, Ukraine says operations are ongoing in Kursk.

""I have already said that a decision has been made to create the necessary security buffer zone along the border,"" Putin said in a video conference with government officials.

""Our armed forces are currently solving this problem.""

Putin said the zone would be along the border of Kursk, Bryansk, and Belgorod oblasts.

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry responded to the statement later in the day, saying Putin's remarks are further evidence that Russia is not meaningfully interested in peace.

""I remind the world that Putin's statements about the 'buffer zone' come amid active efforts to achieve a full, durable ceasefire, stop the killing, and advance peace,"" Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote on X.

""These new aggressive claims clearly reject peace efforts and show that Putin has been and remains the only reason the killing continues. He needs to face more pressure to end this war.""

Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi echoed these sentiments, calling Russia an ""obstacle to peace efforts"" and suggesting that any future ""buffer zone"" be confined to Russian territory.

""These words prove clearly that it is Putin, it is Russia that is an obstacle to peace efforts now and it is they who need to be pressured in all forms to force Russia and Putin to peace and to a full long-term ceasefire,"" he said in a comment to multiple Ukrainian news outlets.

""And as for the 'buffer zones,' there can be a 'buffer zone' on the territory of Russia, which is why Ukraine has been conducting an operation there since last year.""

Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign forces since World War II. While a Russian counteroffensive — supported by North Korean military personnel — recaptured most of the Ukrainian-occupied land in spring 2025, Ukrainian troops continue to carry out missions across the border.

The General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on May 21 that while conditions in the region remain difficult, Ukrainian forces are holding their positions and inflicting losses on Russian troops.

The Kursk operation successfully thwarted Russia's plans to establish a ""buffer zone"" in Sumy Oblast in northeastern Ukraine, Commander in Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in November 2024.

Putin's latest comments regarding a buffer zone comes as Russia has once again rejected U.S. and European proposals for a complete ceasefire in the war against Ukraine. Putin did not agree to the terms in a May 19 phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump and the Kremlin has doubled down on its maximalist demands.

Hundreds of Ukrainian kamikaze drones have flown towards Moscow in recent weeks.

None appear to have even reached the Russian capital, yet the effect on the city — and the wider country — has been hugely significant.

Ukrainian drones have forced at least 217 temporary airport closures across Russia since Jan. 1, independent Russian outlet Novaya Gazeta Europe reported on May 14, citing data from Russia's state aviation agency Rosaviatsia.

The figure already surpasses the combined total for all of 2023 and 2024, underscoring Kyiv's growing ability to put pressure on Russia, even in areas far from the border with Ukraine.

According to Serhii Bratchuk, spokesperson for the Ukrainian Defense Army's Southern Division, the surge in disruptions reflects a strategic shift in Ukraine's drone campaign.

""Moscow is the biggest aviation hub in the Russian Federation — flights go everywhere, not only across Russia, but worldwide,"" he told the Kyiv Independent.

""This is about the potential disintegration of Russian regions and the weakening of internal control.""

Surge in drones targeting Moscow

Three nights of Ukrainian drone raids before Russia's Victory Day on May 9 forced Rosaviatsia to order temporary flight restrictions that disrupted travel plans for at least 60,000 passengers, according to the Association of Tour Operators of Russia.

Just shy of two weeks of calm have been followed by another wave. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that 485 Ukrainian drones had been downed over the past three days, from May 20 to May 22, including 63 over Moscow Oblast.

Overnight on May 23 the attacks continued, with Moscow's Vnukovo, Domodedovo, and Zhukovsky airports forced to suspend operations due to six drones that were ""flying toward Moscow,"" the city's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, claimed.

""Aviation is not a cheap industry, and losses are incurred — by airports, by airlines — and it also has a psychological effect on passengers and cargo clients.""

""The priority direction is clear — Moscow and the surrounding regions,"" Bratchuk said.

Bratchuk highlights that due to Russia's vast geography, air travel is essential for maintaining connectivity, and disruptions in aviation could increase the risk of regional disintegration and public unrest.

""These disruptions are not accidental. They are part of a pressure campaign against logistics, air defense systems, and public morale,"" he said.

""The Russian population has to pay for this war. Sleeping in tents at the airport is not the highest price, but it does affect morale.""

Bratchuk also claims there is an economic cost to Russia in having to constantly close its airports.

""Aviation is not a cheap industry, and losses are incurred by airports, by airlines — but it also has a psychological effect on passengers and cargo clients,"" he said.

The economic damage

But experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said the immediate economic costs for Russia likely remain manageable, suggesting the campaign's primary objective is not to disrupt the economy.

""The economic impact is visible at the level of individual airlines... but the losses are minor,"" Sergei Aleksashenko, a U.S.-based Russian economist, said.

Fellow economist Andrei Movchan was even more skeptical of the financial impact of the campaign

""I don't think there are any economic considerations at all,"" he said.

While the economic fallout may be limited for now, Ukraine's drone campaign is also intended to serve a military purpose beyond financial disruption, Bratchuk said, saying the tactic also forces Russian air defense systems into a constant state of alert.

""Even the smallest aerial target must trigger a full air defense response,"" Bratchuk said. ""That's how the system works — for us, for Russia, and for any country.""

Russia's layered defense network is already under visible strain from Ukraine's now years-long campaign targeting Russian oil production in an attempt to deprive the Kremlin of money to fund its full-scale invasion, as well as military targets like ammunition dumps.

Targeting Moscow and the surrounding oblast with increasing numbers of drones could spread Russia’s air defenses even thinner.

With Russia's air defense units forced to react to every aerial threat, Kyiv appears to be testing the limits of the Kremlin's ability to protect its own territory — a tactic that could lay the groundwork for future strikes with greater precision and deeper penetration.

""Maybe this is one element that would enable our combat drones to strike more effectively at military targets,"" Bratchuk said. ""As for military targets, strikes will continue to hit military-industrial sites in Russia.

That's the only strategy. But the priorities now are somewhat different,"" Bratchuk concluded.

The Russian government is slashing budgets for major projects across a number of sectors in response to plummeting revenues from oil and gas, the pro-Kremlin news outlet Kommersant reported on May 22.

Earlier this month, oil prices in Russia dropped to a two-year low. Prices fell below $50 per barrel — about 40% lower than what was planned in the Russian budget, Reuters reported on May 6.

In response to the price collapse, the Kremlin has introduced sweeping budget cuts to several state programs, Kommersant reports. These include programs to develop Russia's aviation, automotive, tech, shipping, and robotics industries.

The state will cut an aviation development program by 22%, reducing the original budget of 101.2 billion rubles to 78.8 billion. The aim of the program was to replace Western aircraft with Russian planes.

A program aiming to increase the output of Russia's civilian goods by 40% by the year 2030 has also been targeted for funding cuts and is set to lose 66.9 rubles in 2025.

Funds for the nation's ""high-tech industries"" will lose 46 billion rubles, the automotive industry will be slashed by 35 billion rubles, and support for ""the production of innovative transport"" will drop by 25 billion rubles. Funds for the production of ships and ship equipment will lose out on 12.6 billion rubles.

A program to boost the production of industrial robots will lose nearly a third of its budget (1.7 billion out of 5.6 billion rubles).

The Russian state statistics agency Rosstat reported on May 16 that the country is experiencing a significant downturn in economic growth, exacerbated by oil prices, Western sanctions, and inflation.

Oil and gas revenues accounted for nearly 30% of Russia's budget in January and February, according to government data cited by Bloomberg. Moreover, income from fossil fuel exports is a key funding source for Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine.

Soaring military expenditures have strained the Kremlin's budget even as Western sanctions increasingly target Russia's ""shadow fleet"" of oil tankers and the nation's gas exports.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1229695804.jpg

The Council of the European Union will hold a hearing regarding the potential loss of Hungary's voting rights at a meeting on May 27, according to the agenda on the Council's web portal.

This will be the eighth hearing regarding Hungary since the European Parliament triggered Article 7 procedures against the country in 2018. Article 7 of the EU Treaty allows for the suspension of Council voting rights if a member state consistently breaches EU founding principles.

European ministers will discuss Hungary's status at a meeting of the General Affairs Council on May 27, the Council said.

The hearing comes as the EU is looking for ways to override Budapest if it vetoes Ukraine's accession to the bloc. EU High Representative Kaja Kallas said on May 10 that Brussels has alternative plans in the event Hungary attempts to obstructs Ukraine's candidacy.

""We have a plan B and a plan C. But our focus is plan A, the essence of which is to get everyone's support,"" Kallas told reporters.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has repeatedly blocked or delayed EU aid packages for Ukraine while opposing sanctions against Russia. Hungary's ongoing obstruction of support for Ukraine has repeatedly triggered threats to withdraw the country's voting rights.

The European Parliament has also continuously raised Article 7 concerns regarding Hungary's ""erosion of the rule of law."" Under the Orban government, Hungary has faced increasing criticism from international watchdogs for limiting press freedom and undermining democracy.

Mass protests broke out in Budapest on May 18 in response to a controversial bill that would grant the government sweeping powers to investigate, penalize, or even ban media outlets and non-governmental organizations receiving any foreign funding. The bill, proposed by a member of Orban's ruling Fidesz party, is similar to Russia's restrictive ""foreign agents"" law.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176886229.jpg

Russia says 159 Ukrainian drones shot down in less than a day

Russian air defense systems shot down 105 Ukrainian drones overnight on May 22, including 35 intercepted over Moscow Oblast, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that all the drones were flying toward the Russian capital.

Due to the drone attack, all four Moscow airports — Sheremetyevo, Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Zhukovsky — as well as airports in Tambov and Vladimir were temporarily closed.

Other Ukrainian drones were also shot down over the Oryol, Kursk, Belgorod, Tula, Kaluga, Voronezh, Lipetsk, Smolensk, and Bryansk oblasts, the Russian Defense Ministry said.

Tula Oblast Governor Dmitry Milyaev said one of the drones crashed into the roof of an apartment building in Tula. The attack also damaged other residential and non-residential buildings, he said.

Russian authorities haven't reported any other damage or reported any casualties.

Later on May 22, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that 485 Ukrainian drones had been downed over the past three days, from May 20 to May 22, including 63 over Moscow Oblast.

Kyiv hasn't commented on the attacks. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the reports.

9 Ukrainian children rescued from Russian-occupied territories, President's Office says

Ukraine has brought nine more children from Russian-occupied territories to Ukrainian-controlled areas, Presidential Office chief Andriy Yermak said on May 22.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has identified over 19,500 children who have been forcibly deported to Russia, Belarus, or occupied territories. So far, only around 1,300 of them have been safely brought to Ukrainian government-controlled territory.

Among the rescued children is a girl whose life was in danger due to the lack of adequate medical care in the occupied territories, and a boy who, along with his mother, was locked in a basement by Russian forces while his father was tortured in a nearby room, Yermak said.

Others include two sisters who didn't leave their home for nearly three years because of constant shelling and the presence of Russian tanks, and a teenage girl who was cut off from online schooling due to communication blockades imposed by Russian forces.

""These children lived through horrors,"" Yermak said in a statement. ""We are fulfilling the president's task: to bring all children back home.""

Trump tells European leaders Putin doesn’t want peace because he believes Russia winning war in Ukraine, WSJ reports

U.S. President Donald Trump told European leaders this week that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not ready for peace in Ukraine because he believes he is winning the war, the Wall Street Journal reported on May 22, citing three undisclosed sources.

Trump's reported statement marked the first time he acknowledged to European leaders what they and Kyiv have long maintained — the Kremlin has no intention of ending its full-scale war against Ukraine.

The conversation on May 19 reportedly included President Volodymyr Zelensky, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, French President Emmanuel Macron, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and European Council President Antonio Costa.

Earlier the same day, Trump held a phone call with Putin, days after largely inconclusive negotiations in Istanbul, where Russia sent a delegation of low-level officials.

European leaders on the call reportedly seemed ""surprised"" that Trump was ""relatively content"" with what he heard from Putin, Axios reported on May 20.

Kyiv proposes EU partners help directly fund Ukrainian military under new model

Ukraine is requesting the EU begin financially supporting its armed forces starting in 2026, pitching the idea as a practical way to strengthen Europe's collective defense and share the cost of containing Russian aggression, Ukrainian Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko said on May 22.

The EU hasn't so far directly funded Ukraine's military, but member states provide weapons and other assistance through national programs and broader EU support packages.

Marchenko said Kyiv is proposing a new model: European partners would help fund the Ukrainian military, and in return, Ukraine would be further integrated into the continent's defense system.

""I am convinced that this decision has a number of strategic advantages for Ukraine, including maintaining financial stability in 2026 and beyond,"" Marchenko said in a statement following meetings with G7 finance leaders in Canada.

""And for the EU — protection from potential Russian aggression. After all, the Ukrainian army has all the experience necessary for this.""

Under the proposal, the cost of supporting Ukraine's military would represent only a small fraction of the EU's combined GDP, Marchenko said, and could be shared among countries willing to participate. These contributions could count toward NATO defense spending targets.

Russia says 159 Ukrainian drones shot down in less than a day

Russian air defenses reportedly intercepted more than 150 Ukrainian drones over several regions, including areas near the capital, in what appears to be one of the largest such aerial assaults, Russia's Defense Ministry said on May 22.

For at least two days in a row, Ukraine has launched massive waves of drones deep into Russian territory. Between the evening of May 20 and the morning of May 22, Russia claims to have shot down 485 drones on its territory.

According to the Russian military, 159 drones were destroyed between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Moscow time on May 22. The ministry said Ukrainian drones were intercepted across multiple central and western regions, including Moscow, where 22 drones were reportedly shot down. The surrounding regions of Kursk, Oryol, Tula, and others also came under attack, with dozens of drones intercepted in each area.

The ministry described the drones as fixed-wing, aircraft-type unmanned aerial vehicles. The Kyiv Independent couldn't independently verify the claims. Ukrainian authorities have not commented.

Russian air defenses reportedly intercepted more than 150 Ukrainian drones over several regions, including areas near the capital, in what appears to be one of the largest such aerial assaults, Russia's Defense Ministry said on May 22.

For at least two days in a row, Ukraine has launched massive waves of drones deep into Russian territory. Between the evening of May 20 and the morning of May 22, Russia claims to have shot down 485 drones on its territory.

The ministry described the drones as fixed-wing, aircraft-type unmanned aerial vehicles. The Kyiv Independent couldn't independently verify the claims. Ukrainian authorities have not commented.

The reported wave of drone activity follows a broader trend that has intensified in recent months. Ukraine has increasingly targeted Moscow and its surrounding regions.

While few drones appear to have reached the capital itself, their mere approach has already forced widespread disruption. Since the beginning of the year, Russian airports have been temporarily shut down at least 217 times due to drone threats.

Recently, Ukrainian drones struck Russia's Bolkhov semiconductor plant in Oryol Oblast, which produces parts for Sukhoi warplanes and Iskander and Kinzhal missiles. The facility provides components to at least 19 Russian factories engaged in manufacturing Sukhoi fighter jets as well as Iskander and Kinzhal ballistic missiles.

In April President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukraine is ramping up drone production to the ""maximum.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1242279354.jpeg

""Over the past three years, Ukraine has received more than $133 billion in international financial aid,"" he said. ""This support enabled the government to preserve macro-financial stability during full-scale war, ensure salary payments to teachers, doctors, and public servants, and continue pensions and social support for the most vulnerable.""

""The financial system still faces challenges, which makes continued external support absolutely critical,"" the minister said.

With war still raging and Russia showing no signs of backing down, Marchenko argued that relying solely on building up national armies across Europe could take years and require enormous resources.

U.S. President Donald Trump proposed a full ceasefire in March. Ukraine immediately agreed, and the plan was supported by European leaders.

Russia has consistently refused, culminating in a phone call on May 19 between Trump and President Vladimir Putin, during which Putin once again rejected the proposal and instead demanded a ""memorandum regarding a potential future peace treaty.""

On May 16, Russia initiated peace talks in Istanbul but sent only a low-level delegation led by Putin aide Vladimir Medinsky and reiterated demands that Kyiv cede Crimea and four eastern regions. President Putin and Lavrov were both absent.

Recently, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov virtually confirmed Moscow has no interest in negotiations or a ceasefire, saying on May 21 that ""we don't want this anymore.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/499425666_10238356919807625_1861473076906753662_n.jpg

Ukraine has brought nine more children from Russian-occupied territories to Ukrainian-controlled areas, Presidential Office chief Andriy Yermak said on May 22.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has identified over 19,500 children who have been forcibly deported to Russia, Belarus, or occupied territories. So far, only around 1,300 of them have been safely brought to Ukrainian government-controlled territory.

Among the rescued children is a girl whose life was in danger due to the lack of adequate medical care in the occupied territories, and a boy who, along with his mother, was locked in a basement by Russian forces while his father was tortured in a nearby room, Yermak said.

Others include two sisters who didn't leave their home for nearly three years because of constant shelling and the presence of Russian tanks, and a teenage girl who was cut off from online schooling due to communication blockades imposed by Russian forces.

""These children lived through horrors,"" Yermak said in a statement. ""We are fulfilling the president's task: to bring all children back home.""

The rescue mission was conducted as part of Bring Kids Back UA, a national initiative spearheaded by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and coordinated by his office to return deported children to their families and communities.

Ukrainian children forcibly taken to Russia or Russian-occupied territories are placed in families or Russian camps, where they are known to be subjected to intense anti-Ukrainian propaganda, and at times, military training.

Kyiv has repeatedly stated that returning all these children is a key condition for any future peace agreement with Russia.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has also taken up the matter. In March 2023, it issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Children's Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova over their involvement in abductions.

On May 8, the European Parliament overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning Russia's forcible deportation and Russification of Ukrainian children, calling it a ""genocidal strategy"" aimed at erasing Ukrainian identity and demanding the unconditional return of all abducted minors.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1247413769.jpg

Ukrainian defense manufacturers have issued a public letter to President Volodymyr Zelensky, urging him to lift export restrictions on domestically produced military-grade equipment, particularly drones, to help the sector grow and integrate better into Europe's security architecture.

The open letter, signed by leading representatives of Ukraine's defense-industrial sector, highlights the strategic potential of the country's homegrown military technologies, from drones to electronic warfare systems, and calls for decisive political action to authorize the controlled export of surplus weaponry to allied nations.

""It is time to demonstrate that Ukraine is capable of being not only a party that receives international support, but also a full-fledged partner that exports security through cooperation, technology, and its own experience,"" the letter reads.

Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine's defense sector — and its drone industry in particular — has exploded. More than 200 drone companies have emerged, many producing cheap, adaptable systems that have reshaped modern warfare. Industry leaders have previously said many smaller firms are burning through capital with no lifeline in sight.

Under the current laws, drones and other dual-use military goods require a permit from the State Export Service. But drone producers earlier told the Kyiv Independent that those waivers are nearly impossible to obtain — even for companies the government cannot afford to contract. The system, they say, blocks access to global markets just as foreign demand is surging.

""As Europe grapples with transatlantic uncertainty and armed conflicts escalate worldwide, our strategic partners are actively seeking to strengthen their defense capabilities through innovative and affordable technological solutions,"" the letter reads.

""And here, Ukraine holds a unique advantage. Our defense industry — evolving under constant battlefield conditions — is already producing the technologies the world is looking for.""

Kateryna Mykhalko, executive director of Tech Force in UA, told the Kyiv Independent in May 2024 that Ukraine manufactures a lot of drones, but ""not all of them can be used in the army.""

""Export is one way to ensure that companies do not go bankrupt, develop their R&D, and perhaps in the future the military will need their products,"" she said.

Ukraine's defense industry was capable of producing up to $20 billion in equipment in 2024, but the government could fund only half, then-Strategic Industries Oleksandr Kamyshin Minister said in May of last year.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1957348817.jpg

The European Parliament approved on May 22 increased tariffs on fertilizers and certain agricultural goods from Russia and Belarus, seeking to reduce EU dependence on those imports.

Tariffs on some nitrogen fertilizers will rise from 6.5% to around 100% over three years, a level that will effectively stop trade. An additional 50% duty will be applied to agricultural products from the two allied countries.

The new tariffs target the remaining 15% of agricultural imports from Russia that were previously duty-free, worth 380 million euro ($429 million), Reuters reported. These include products such as meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables.

Revenue from the sale of Russian and Belarusian fertilizers is considered a direct contribution to Moscow's full-scale war against Ukraine, the statement read.

""The regulation gradually increasing customs duties for products from Russia and Belarus will help to prevent Russia from using the EU market to finance its war machine,"" said Inese Vaidere, Latvian Member of the European Parliament.

The tariff increase is expected to take effect on July 1.

Previously, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed that if the EU imposes steep tariffs on Russian nitrogen fertilizers, it would lead to higher costs and lower quality for the European Union.

Imports of urea and nitrogen-based fertilizers from Russia to the EU were already high in 2023 and rose even more in 2024.

The European Commission said that this shows the EU is economically dependent on Russia. If this continues, it could threaten the EU’s food security and make the bloc vulnerable to pressure from Russia, especially through fertilizer supply, the statement read.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1775102025.jpeg

Ukraine regularly launches drone attacks against Russian military and industrial facilities in the rear to undermine Russia's ability to wage its all-out war.

Romania's Constitutional Court on May 22 unanimously rejected an application by defeated presidential candidate George Simion to annul the election results, the court announced in a statement.

Days before, Simion, leader of Romania's far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), appealed the results despite conceding defeat to pro-EU candidate Nicusor Dan on May 18. He asked to annul the Romanian presidential elections due to ""external interferences by state and non-state actors.""

Simion cited a post from Telegram CEO Pavel Durov, who claimed a ""Western European government"" asked the company to restrict ""conservative voices in Romania.""

The court rejected Simion's application as ""unfounded.""

Dan, the mayor of Bucharest, secured 53.6% of the vote in the runoff, defeating Simion's 46.4%, according to Romania's electoral authority.

""The massive vote on May 18 shows that Romanians believe in change and are calling for the reform of institutions that have disappointed them,"" Dan said after the court approved the results.

Romania's previous presidential election, held in November 2024, was annulled by the Constitutional Court following evidence of foreign manipulation, including pro-Russian disinformation campaigns.

That vote was won by populist candidate Calin Georgescu, who openly promoted conspiracy theories and described Ukraine as a ""fictional state.""

Bucharest has played a critical role in Ukraine's defense, signing a bilateral security pact with Kyiv, facilitating grain exports, and providing key air defense systems.

Dan has pledged to continue Romania's support for Ukraine, strengthen ties with the EU, and uphold democratic institutions.

In the early 19th century, one of the founding fathers of modern war studies, the Prussian general and military historian Carl von Clausewitz, commented on the Napoleonic Wars: ""The conqueror is always peace-loving; he would much prefer to march into our state calmly.""

This remains an observation that applies to most military aggressions.

Yet, Clausewitz's basic idea was ignored by most Europeans in their interpretation of Moscow's behaviour after the start of the Russo-Ukrainian War in 2014.

Much of European diplomacy and commentary until 2022 instead built on the assumption that the Kremlin's public insistence on the peacefulness of its intentions towards Kyiv implies that one can and should negotiate and moderate Russian aims and behaviour in Ukraine.

This inapt premise ignored that Russian President Vladimir Putin merely preferred Ukraine's non-violent takeover to an uncertain future military campaign against Kyiv. When, eleven years ago, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea and covertly invaded eastern Ukraine, the war as such had no benefits for Putin and his entourage.

Instead, a hybrid subversion of Ukraine by Russian agents and proxy forces, rather than a violent occupation of most of the Ukrainian lands by tens of thousands of regular Russian troops, was the preferred method.

During the last three years, however, the role of Russia's - now full-scale - military invasion of Ukraine for Putin's regime has changed. One the one side, the war itself has acquired a stabilizing function for the Russian political system that relies on an increasingly extremist ideology, militarized economy and mobilized society. On the other side, most European politicians, diplomats and experts now have fewer illusions about Putin's putative love for peace than they had a decade ago.

In contrast, the hitherto largely adequate perception of Moscow's strategy in Washington has been replaced, since January 2025, by an escapist approach to the Russo-Ukrainian War.

The degree of the new U.S. administration's political naivety, moral indifference and diplomatic dilettantism, during its first four months in office, has been astonishing. Even in view of the aberrations during Trump's first presidency of 2017-2021, the inadequacy of the last months' statements and actions by the White House regarding the Russo-Ukrainian War has triggered shockwaves in Europe and elsewhere.

One suspects that not only strategic infantilism, but also political respect and even personal sympathy, in the Trump administration, for Putin, have been driving the recent zigzags of the U.S.

Four months of American shuttle diplomacy and mediation attempts have achieved only little. The results of this week's two-hour conversation between Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump have also been meagre. To be sure, the two presidents spoke, after their telephone talk, of success.

Yet, there are no tangible outcomes of the intense trilateral negotiations between Washington, Moscow, and Kyiv, and of the direct interactions between the U.S. and Russian presidents.

Putin made it clear that there would not be any ceasefire soon.

Russian imperialism will not be neutralized by negotiations, compromises, or concessions.

Trump announced that there should be direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, as if the two countries had not been negotiating with each other, in different formats, for more than eleven years already.

In his comment about Monday's phone call, Putin, in fact, engaged in a trolling of Ukraine, the U.S., and the entire West in two ways.

First, the term that Russia has recently introduced and Putin used to label the primary aim to be achieved in upcoming negotiations is ""memorandum."" Everybody familiar with the history of post-Soviet Russo-Ukrainian relations will know that there exists already a historic security-related ""memorandum"" signed by Moscow and Kyiv (as well as Washington and London) at Hungary's capital more than 30 years ago.

In the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, Moscow guaranteed, in exchange for Kyiv's agreement to hand over all of its nuclear warheads to Russia, that it would not attack Ukraine. Washington and London too assured Kyiv that they respect the Ukrainian borders and sovereignty.

After Moscow has been demonstratively trampling the letter and spirit of the Budapest Memorandum for eleven years, the Kremlin is now offering to sign another Russo-Ukrainian ""memorandum.""

Second, Putin did not exclude, after speaking to Trump, that future negotiations with Kyiv may lead to a truce. Yet, the Russian president added that, ""if appropriate agreements are reached,"" a ""possible ceasefire"" would only be ""for a certain period of time."" Even if the negotiations are successful, the armistice will be merely temporary.

That caveat by Putin is an apt admission: The Russian war economy and population's military mobilization are now so far advanced that they cannot be easily stopped. Moscow is not any longer able to abruptly discontinue warfighting. What would happen to Russia's hundreds of thousands of enlisted soldiers, large-scale weapons production, and routine bellicose as well as intense Ukrainophobic campaigns in many spheres of Russian social life (education, media, culture etc.), if there is suddenly a permanent peace?

These and similar signals from Moscow allow only one conclusion: To end the Russo-Ukrainian War, Russia needs to experience a humiliating defeat on the battlefield.

The lesson from the past is, moreover, that Russian military failures have triggered domestic liberalization, such as the Great Reforms after the Crimean War of 1854-1856, or the introduction of semi-constitutionalism following the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905.

One of the determinants of Glasnost and Perestroika was the disastrous failure of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979-1989.

Russian imperialism will not be neutralized by negotiations, compromises, or concessions. Instead, such approaches only promote further foreign adventurism in Moscow and military escalation along Russia's borders. The Kremlin will one day end Russia's expansionist wars as well as genocidal terror against civilians in Ukraine and elsewhere. Yet for that to happen, the Russian people first need to start believing that such behaviour cannot lead to victory, may trigger internal collapse, and will be resolutely punished.

North Korea’s newly-built warship suffered damage during its launch ceremony on May 21, prompting outrage from the country's leader Kim Jong Un, North Korean state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.

According to the agency, a malfunction in the launch mechanism caused the stern of the 5,000-ton destroyer to slide into the water too early, while the rest of the ship remained stuck.

Damage to the bottom of the ship threw it off balance, and the bow failed to move, resulting in ""a serious accident.""

Kim condemned the failed launch as a ""criminal act"" and placed blame on several state institutions, accusing relevant officials of ""irresponsibility"" which ""could not be tolerated.""

He reportedly described the vessel's restoration as ""a political issue directly tied to the prestige of the state.""

The incident was attributed to ""inexperienced command and operational carelessness,"" KCNA said.

The news came amid North Korea’s focus on upgrading its conventional military alongside its nuclear and missile capabilities.

The incident is expected to be reviewed at the June plenary session of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea. According to KCNA, the recovery of the ship was ordered to be completed by then.

In recent weeks, Kim has also overseen the launch of a new naval destroyer and observed tests of new drone systems.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has confirmed that Moscow has no interest in negotiations and agreeing to a ceasefire in Ukraine, saying on May 21 that ""we don't want this anymore.""

Describing the U.S.-led push for a full, 30-day truce as a ""let’s have a ceasefire and then we’ll see"" tactic, Lavrov insisted the ""root causes"" of the war need to be resolved first.

""We have already been in these stories, we don’t want this anymore,"" Lavrov said, referring to failed negotiations between Moscow and Ukraine following the onset of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine in February 2022.

U.S. President Donald Trump proposed a full ceasefire in March. Ukraine immediately agreed and the initiative has been backed by Kyiv's European allies.

Russia has consistently refused, culminating in a phone call on May 19 between Trump and Vladimir Putin, during which the Russian president once again rejected the proposal, instead insisting on negotiating a ""memorandum regarding a potential future peace treaty.""

Trump briefed European leaders on the contents of the call, telling them that Putin is not ready for peace in Ukraine because he believes he is winning the war, the Wall Street Journal reported on May 22.

The same European leaders were reportedly seemed ""surprised"" that Trump was ""relatively content"" with what he heard from Putin, Axios reported on May 20.

During a talk with students at a Russian university, Lavrov also accused European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, of pushing Trump to tighten sanctions against Russia.

Russia initiated peace talks with Ukraine, which took place on May 16, following Moscow's rejection of calls from Ukraine and its allies for an immediate ceasefire.

The talks were largely inconclusive. Russia announced its delegation would consist of low-level officials, led by Putin's aide, Vladimir Medinsky. Moscow reiterated maximalist demands, including that Ukraine accept the loss of Crimea and four eastern regions.

Putin did not attend the Istanbul peace talks on May 16, despite an invitation from President Volodymyr Zelensky to meet him face-to-face.

Andriy Portnov, a former top official in Ukraine's ex-President Viktor Yanukovych’s administration, was shot dead by unidentified attackers outside the American School in Madrid, Reuters reported on May 21, citing a source close to the investigation.

A source in Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent that Portnov was indeed shot dead, based on preliminary information. No further details were provided.

Portnov served in the administration of then-President Yanukovych between 2010 and 2014. After the EuroMaidan Revolution, he lived alternately abroad and in Ukraine and was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2021 over allegations that he was involved in corruption, particularly in the judiciary.

The shooting took place at around 9:15 a.m. local time, with Portnov being shot at five times and suffering at least three wounds to his head and torso, Spanish newspaper El Pais reported, citing undisclosed police sources. The shot to the head proved fatal, the outlet wrote.

Two or three people are believed to be involved in the attack, though no arrests have been made so far. The newspaper's sources suggested debt issues as a possible motive.

Portnov was approaching his Mercedes car when he was surprised and shot by the attackers. He was found at the entrance to the American School, El Pais reported. Emergency services found the man dead upon their arrival, according to the outlet.

Madrid emergency services confirmed on social media that a man was shot dead in the area, without naming the victim. El Pais reported that Portnov was identified as a father at the school. He has four children.

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Ukrainska Pravda, and other outlets have also reported the story, citing their sources.

Portnov, a lawyer, was known as one of the most litigious Ukrainian ex-officials. He filed a defamation lawsuit against several media outlets, including the Kyiv Independent, over a reference to him as ""pro-Russian.""

The lawsuit concerned a story by Glib Kanievskyi, then a Ukrainian journalist and currently a defense ministry official, published in several news outlets, including the Kyiv Independent, in September 2023. A Kyiv court ruled in Portnov's favor in September 2024.

Portnov led the legal team of then-Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko in 2005-2010 and sat in the parliament between 2006 and 2010. After 2010, he became the head of Yanukovych's main judiciary department and deputy head of his administration.

The ex-official left Ukraine for Russia and later Austria after Yanukovych was ousted in the EuroMaidan Revolution in 2014, but returned to Ukraine in 2019. Portnov fled Ukraine again in 2022 after Russia's full-scale invasion broke out, even though the travel ban for military-age men was already in effect.

U.S. President Donald Trump told European leaders this week that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not ready for peace in Ukraine because he believes he is winning the war, the Wall Street Journal reported on May 22, citing three undisclosed sources.

Trump's reported statement marked the first time he acknowledged to European leaders what they and Kyiv have long maintained — the Kremlin has no intention of ending its full-scale war against Ukraine.

The conversation on May 19 reportedly included President Volodymyr Zelensky, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, French President Emmanuel Macron, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and European Council President Antonio Costa.

Earlier the same day, Trump held a phone call with Putin, days after largely inconclusive negotiations in Istanbul, where Russia sent a delegation of low-level officials.

European leaders on the call reportedly seemed ""surprised"" that Trump was ""relatively content"" with what he heard from Putin, Axios reported on May 20.

Despite U.S. efforts, Putin has shown little willingness to compromise to achieve a settlement. After the call, Putin reiterated Russia's maximalist demands, denying full ceasefire agreement.

Since taking the office in January, Trump has been inconsistent in his rhetoric toward the Russian leader, at times voicing frustration with the stalled peace efforts but mostly avoiding direct criticism of Putin.

Although Trump now seems to recognize that Putin is not prepared to pursue peace, the White House so far has not yet imposed new sanctions or taken direct steps to penalize Russia, despite growing frustration among allies.

Finland expects a Russian military build up on its borders after the war in Ukraine ends, the Guardian reported on May 21.

Major General Sami Nurmi, the head of strategy of the Finnish defense forces said in an interview that the Russian military has begun ""moderate preparations when it comes to building infrastructure"" close to Finnish borders.

Since the start of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, NATO officials have increasingly warned Moscow could attack the alliance's members in the coming years.

Finland shares a 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) border with Russia and joined NATO in 2023.

""They are doing it in phases. I would say it is still moderate numbers. It’s not big construction, but in certain places building new infrastructure and preparing, bringing new equipment in,"" Nurmi said.

According to Nurmi, once the war in Ukraine concludes, the Russian military is expected to begin redeploying its forces involved in the fighting in Ukraine.

""You also have to evaluate whether they are preparing to send more troops to Ukraine or preparing to build up their forces close to our border. But I guess they are doing both,"" he added.

Previously, on May 19, the New York Times published satellite images which seem to indicate an expansion of military facilities near the Finnish border.

The Finnish Border Guard announced the completion of the first 35 km (22 miles) of a planned 200 km fence along its eastern border with Russia, on May 21.

The border has been closed for over a year after Helsinki accused Moscow of orchestrating a ""hybrid operation"" by directing asylum seekers toward Finland.

Finnish authorities claim that these hybrid tactics have intensified since the country joined NATO in 2023.

U.S. President Donald Trump, when asked about Russia’s recent actions on May 20, said that he had ""no concerns,"" assuring that Finland and Norway would remain ""very safe.""

""It doesn’t concern me at all. They’re totally safe. These are two countries that will be very safe,"" Trump said.

Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said last December that Russia must be ready for a potential conflict with NATO in the next 10 years. Moscow has also issued a number of veiled and overt threats to the West over its support for Kyiv, including warnings of a possible nuclear response.

Thirty-eight drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are usually decoys. Russia launches them alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine's air defense.

Editor's Note: In 2023, Andriy Portnov filed a lawsuit against Olga Rudenko, the chief editor of the Kyiv Independent, over an article in which he was referenced as being ""pro-Russian."" A Kyiv court ruled in Portnov's favor in September 2024. In April 2025, an appeal court upheld the ruling. Rudenko filed a cassation appeal, which is currently under review.

Andriy Portnov had been no stranger to controversy. He was the architect of Ukraine's judiciary, corrupt and unreformed, and was known to attack everyone who dared to speak out.

Portnov was the epitome of the Kremlin-friendly Ukraine of President Viktor Yanukovych, where fair trial was a luxury and civil liberties were a dream.

""It doesn't matter to us whether he was a useful idiot or a paid agent,"" Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, a lawmaker from the liberal Holos party, told the Kyiv Independent. ""But he undoubtedly acted in Russia's interests.""

""He was an architect of Yanukovych's corrupt system and personally influenced the appointment of judges,"" Mykhailo Zhernakov, head of judicial watchdog Dejure, told the Kyiv Independent.

His life ended in a way that symbolized that long-gone system — killed without a trial.

Until his last days, Portnov was reportedly wielding immense influence on the judiciary and interfering with the courts despite being absent from Ukraine for years.

Portnov has denied the accusations of acting in the Kremlin's interests and illegally interfering in the judiciary, suing news outlets that dared to make that statement.

Fighting with journalists, businessmen, and politicians, Portnov amassed an immense list of enemies. As such, the murder case in itself will be a complicated endeavor, as finding the perpetrators will be an uneasy task.

A career of ups and downs

Portnov, born in now-occupied Luhansk in 1973, had a law degree from the city's East Ukrainian National University.

In the 1990s and 2000s, he worked as a private lawyer and an official at the State Securities and Stock Market Commission.

From 2005 to 2010, Portnov was an ally of then-Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and a lawmaker representing her party in parliament.

After Tymoshenko lost the 2010 presidential election to Yanukovych, Portnov switched to the latter and became his deputy chief of staff responsible for the judiciary. Tymoshenko, Yanukovych's main political opponent, was jailed in a politically motivated case at the same time as Portnov ran the judicial system in Yanykovych's interests.

Portnov also led the development of Ukraine's Criminal Procedure Code, which was adopted in 2012 and was later criticized for creating obstacles for fair trials and obstructing corruption investigations.

Yurchyshyn said that, under Yanukovych, Portnov spearheaded the subordination of the judiciary to the presidential administration. The Ukrainian judiciary's current problems and challenges partially stem from Portnov's activities, he added.

In 2019, a judiciary source told journalists that would later found the Kyiv Independent that Portnov and Andriy Bohdan, who would later become President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff, had pressured Petro Stetsyuk, a judge of the Constitutional Court, to issue a ruling to help Yanukovych monopolize power in 2010.

The Constitutional Court ruling allowed lawmakers to switch parties, allowing dozens of lawmakers to leave Tymoshenko's party and join that of Yanukovych. Soon, the parliament was under Yanukovych's full control.

Bohdan did not respond to requests for comment.

After Yanukovych was ousted by the EuroMaidan Revolution in 2014, Portnov left Ukraine and moved to Vienna. He also bought real estate in Moscow and its vicinity, according to the Schemes investigative journalism project.

Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office charged Portnov with embezzlement and abuse of power in 2014, but the case was later closed.

In 2018, the Security Service of Ukraine also opened a treason case against Portnov over his alleged participation in Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. However, he was not officially charged, and the case was closed in 2019.

Portnov was also sanctioned by the EU along with other top Yanukovych associates in 2014 but the sanctions were lifted in 2016 due to a lack of evidence in the criminal cases against him.

He kept his influence in Ukraine even after the EuroMaidan Revolution and owned the pro-Russian TV channel NewsOne in 2018.

Portnov in Zelensky's Ukraine

After Zelensky was elected president in 2019, Portnov returned to Ukraine and reportedly increased his influence on the political system and law enforcement.

Bohdan, who was Zelensky's chief of staff from 2019 to 2020, said then that he had been friends with Portnov for many years. He had also been an aide to Portnov from 2007 to 2009.

Another Portnov associate, Oleh Tatarov, was appointed Zelensky's deputy chief of staff in charge of law enforcement in 2020. Tatarov had defended Portnov's interests as a lawyer after the EuroMaidan Revolution.

Tatarov also gained notoriety after being charged with bribery in 2020, although the case against him was dropped by law enforcement and closed in 2022. For anti-corruption activists, he has become a symbol of Zelensky's tolerance for graft.

Under Zelensky, Portnov initiated several criminal cases against ex-President Petro Poroshenko, Zelensky's main political opponent.

Portnov also maintained links with Ukraine's most controversial judge, Pavlo Vovk.

Vovk has become a symbol of lawlessness and corruption in Ukraine. He has been charged in several cases for alleged obstruction of justice and corruption, sanctioned by the U.S. in 2022 and eventually fired in 2025.

In 2019, Portnov, Bohdan, and Vovk allegedly discussed appointing Oleksandr Tupytsky as chairman of the Constitutional Court, according to audio recordings cited by news outlets Slidstvo, Censor, and the Kyiv Post at the time.

Tupytsky became the court's head the same year, and under his leadership, the Constitutional Court undermined several anti-corruption reforms, including by destroying the online asset declaration system for top officials.

Tupytsky was fired and charged in several criminal cases in 2021. He fled Ukraine and moved to Vienna in 2022.

Yurchyshyn argued that, through Tupytsky's court, Portnov undermined Ukrainian reforms in the interests of Russia since they jeopardized the country's European integration.

Both Portnov and Tupytsky were sanctioned by the U.S. in 2019.

The U.S. Treasury Department said that ""in mid-2019, Portnov colluded with a high-ranking Ukrainian government official to shape the country's higher legal institutions to their advantage and influence Ukraine's Constitutional Court.""

The department also said that Portnov ""took steps to control the Ukrainian judiciary, influence associated legislation, sought to place loyal officials in senior judiciary positions, and purchase court decisions"" in 2019.

Portnov and Vovk also influenced the appointment of Bohdan Monich as head of Ukraine's Council of Judges, a self-regulation body, in 2019, according to audio recordings cited by Slidstvo. Monich did not respond to a request for comment.

The Council of Judges regulates the daily work of the country's judiciary, the control of which allegedly gave Portnov once again vast powers over the country's unreformed court system.

After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Portnov left Ukraine in June 2022, according to the Schemes news outlet.

While abroad, Portnov has been eager to whitewash his reputation, which was tainted in Ukraine.

He routinely filed libel lawsuits against independent media that criticized him, reportedly using his influence over the judiciary to win cases.

One of the lawsuits was filed against several media outlets and Olga Rudenko, the chief editor of the Kyiv Independent, over an article in which he was referenced as being ""pro-Russian.""

The lawsuit concerned a story by Glib Kanievskyi, then a Ukrainian journalist and currently a defense ministry official, published in several news outlets, including the Kyiv Independent, in September 2023. A Kyiv court ruled in Portnov's favor in September 2024.

In a separate case, Portnov published detailed information about journalists investigating him, including a car license and a home address. He added that the journalists should be “careful” driving at night.

""It was systematic work aimed at hampering the functioning of independent media,"" Yurchyshyn said.

Portnov's last day

Portnov, whose location wasn't known to the wider public, was shot dead by unidentified attackers outside the American School in Madrid on May 21.

The shooting took place at around 9:15 a.m. local time, with Portnov being shot at five times and suffering at least three wounds to his head and torso, Spanish newspaper El Pais reported, citing undisclosed police sources.

A Russian vessel under international sanctions made ""suspicious"" maneuvers near a key undersea power cable connecting Poland and Sweden before being forced to retreat following a military intervention, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on May 21.

""After the effective intervention of our military, the ship sailed to one of the Russian ports. (Polish survey ship) ORP Heweliusz is sailing to the scene,"" Tusk wrote on X.

The incident comes a day after the European Union formally adopted its 17th package of sanctions against Russia, aimed at curbing hybrid threats and penalizing vessels involved in circumventing existing restrictions.

The new measures specifically target nearly 200 ships believed to be part of Moscow's so-called ""shadow fleet"" used to transport oil and other cargo in defiance of Western sanctions.

Recently, a series of incidents severed cables and disrupted signals in the Baltic Sea region. While U.S. and European intelligence officials have suggested some of the damage may have been accidental, some senior officials, argue that repeated disruptions cannot be explained by ""poor seamanship"" alone.

Ukraine’s military has once again been rocked by a scandal around its leadership culture, with another high-profile commander speaking out against the country’s top brass over bad orders leading to excess losses.

On May 16, well-renowned officer Oleksandr Shyrshyn, callsign “Genius,” announced his resignation from his position as battalion commander of Ukraine’s 47th Mechanized Brigade.

""I’ve never received dumber orders than the ones in our current sector,” wrote Shyrshyn, whose brigade was moved to Russia’s Kursk Oblast in October and is now holding the line along the border with Ukraine’s Sumy Oblast.

“Someday I’ll tell the details, but this idiotic loss of people and trembling before incompetent generals leads to nothing but failures. All they’re capable of is reprimands, investigations, and disciplinary sanctions.""

Shyrshyn’s accusations point to actions by the military leadership leading to excess losses of personnel, equipment, and territory, borne out of a systemic disconnect from the soldiers fighting on the ground.

Raised before in a series of scandals that have rocked the Ukrainian military under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, the issues are related closely to perceptions of an inefficient, “Soviet”-style command culture that has plagued the Armed Forces since Ukraine’s independence.

Over 2025, efforts have been made to reform the leadership through personnel changes in the General Staff and a gradual transition to a corps system, but many of the changes are yet to be felt on the ground.

“Thank you, General Staff!” read the last line of the commander’s Facebook post. “I hope that your children will serve in the infantry and carry out your orders.”

The announcement was soon picked up by Ukrainian media, with different commanders and other high-profile military figures weighing in.

The Kyiv Independent reached out to the General Staff for comment but hasn’t received a response as of publication time.

In a post on Facebook, the General Staff said it would conduct an internal investigation into the circumstances that led to Shyrshyn’s announcement.

“Additionally, orders and directives issued from various levels of military command will be analyzed in detail to assess the appropriateness of the decisions made under the existing combat conditions,"" the statement read.

The Kyiv Independent spoke to two fellow officers — one current and one former — from Shyrshyn’s battalion, both of whom backed the commander.

Toughest battles

A native of Mykolaiv and prominent figure in Ukrainian civil society, Shyrshyn began his military career in Ukraine’s 80th Air Assault Brigade, signing a reservist contract right before the launch of Russia’s full-scale invasion.

In January 2023, Shyrshyn gained attention when a photo of him reading U.S. professor Timothy Snyder’s book “On the Road to Unfreedom” while lying in a trench went viral online.

In summer that year, Shyrshyn took part in the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive in Zaporizhzhia Oblast as a company commander in the newly-formed 47th Mechanized Brigade, which was famously trained in NATO countries and equipped with Ukraine’s first Leopard 2 tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles.

Fighting at the spearhead of the much-awaited counteroffensive, the brigade, which had not seen combat prior, quickly took heavy losses after it was ordered to assault the best-defended part of Russia’s Surovikin Line of fortifications.

Nonetheless, soldiers fighting under Shyrshyn said that despite the difficult conditions, the commander always went above and beyond to carry out orders while also preserving the lives of his rank and file.

""Our commander has never assigned a task he wouldn’t carry out himself. That’s why he is deeply respected by the entire personnel,"" said an officer still serving in Shyrshyn’s battalion, who asked to be identified only by his callsign “SAS” due to security reasons.

“Genius (Shyrshyn) feels a deep sense of responsibility for his position, for his battalion, and for the people who trust him with their survival — every day, without exception.""

Then serving as company commander, Shyrshyn often led his soldiers on combat missions, including assaults and evacuations, often rarity among higher-ranking officers, said machine gunner and squad leader Oleksii Nazarenko, who served for seven months under Shyrshyn, to the Kyiv Independent. “He was very involved in order to protect the personnel as a whole,” he said.

“He was there whenever there were issues related to evacuating people — it was never the case that he tried to avoid responsibility or distance himself.”

""Our brigade has consistently been sent into the areas with the most intense fighting.""

In October 2023, when the counteroffensive had culminated, the 47th was transferred to Avdiivka in Donetsk Oblast, where Russia had launched a fresh new offensive.

Over the following months, the brigade fought at the center of the most intense sector of the front line, as Russian forces overwhelmed Ukrainian defensive lines behind Avdiivka and pierced toward the city of Pokrovsk.

During the Pokrovsk campaign, Shyrshyn — by now 1st Battalion commander — already then made headlines for speaking out against the higher command, claiming that his battalion was sent to hold nearly-encircled positions after neighboring units had buckled.

“Because of the ‘not a step back, we stand till the last soldier’ attitude of our generals, we suffered losses that were avoidable,” he said to Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske in July.

For Nazarenko, the brutality of the infantry war in the 47th’s sector, combined with the often impossible missions set by higher command, led him to leave the brigade in February 2024.

“They (higher command) kept carrying out the same kind of orders over and over, which simply led to dead ends — we were running out of equipment, and we were running out of people,” he said.

Final straw

Just a few weeks after Ukrainian forces broke across the state border with Russia in a surprise offensive on Kursk Oblast, the 47th Brigade, with its Leopard and Abrams tanks, was soon redeployed to this new front.

With Russia deploying thousands of North Korean troops to expel Ukrainian forces from Kursk Oblast, along with some of its best drone units armed with unjammable fiber optic drones, maintaining the area became increasingly costly for Kyiv.



Finally coming in March 2025, the Ukrainian command’s decision to withdraw so late from Kursk salient was publicly criticized at the time, with testimonies and visuals pointing to a surge in vehicle and personnel losses during the retreat.

For the 47th Brigade, deployed in the sector deepest inside Russian territory with the most exposed logistics routes, the delay was especially painful.

""Our brigade has consistently been sent into the areas with the most intense fighting,” said SAS. “This particular sector differs only in that it is politically important to our top political leadership.”



“It’s crucial for them to hold this area at any cost, and that’s precisely why they disregard the number of human losses required to retain this land, this territory.""

Culture war

Shyrshyn’s complaints align with ongoing, widely-held criticism of the command culture of Ukraine’s military leadership that escalated over the second half of 2024 and into 2025 as Kyiv’s fortunes worsened on the battlefield.

The problems are often associated with mentality and working practices that lead to false reporting delivered up the command chain, impossible or “suicide” orders delivered back down to commanders in the field, and a general prioritization of results on paper and personal reputation of ranking officers over the lives of personnel.

Often, as Shyrshyn mentioned, these issues are manifested in orders handed down to battalion commanders like him that in no way correspond to the combat strength of the unit, and are certain to only result in unnecessary losses.

“Which position to retake, which tree line to clear — completely populist, unjustified, unsupported — idiotic assault operations or missions that senselessly put personnel in danger.""

Faced with a disconnect between high command and the reality on the ground, commanders at brigade and battalion level like Shyrshyn are often then forced to do their best to stand up for their personnel, communicate the need for better orders upwards, and find the best possible compromise between carrying out the order and protecting their soldiers.

But according to SAS, these attempts mostly fell on deaf ears.

“Shyrshyn submitted out-of-turn reports about the impossibility of carrying out these orders, offered proposals on how the objectives assigned could be fulfilled and consistently shared his opinions — directly and straightforwardly, as he always does,” said the officer.

“Going public was a logical next step after a person grows tired of fighting windmills. If you hit a wall a hundred times, maybe it’s just easier to open a window on Facebook and write it there.""

As of the time of publication, Ukraine’s General Staff has not responded to questions from the Kyiv Independent about Shyrshyn’s resignation and the pending investigation.

Speaking out

Shyrshyn’s post was met with words of support from many serving and former soldiers, as well as high-profile journalists and volunteers.

Bohdan Krotevych, the former chief of staff of the National Guard’s Azov Brigade, who made headlines in June 2024 for a similar public move against Ukrainian general Yurii Sodol, asserted that Ukraine’s very highest leadership should be held responsible for excess losses.

“Nearly 99.9% of the tasks assigned to the battalions are direct orders from the General Staff,” Krotevych wrote on X.



“Which position to retake, which tree line to clear — completely populist, unjustified, unsupported — idiotic assault operations or missions that senselessly put personnel in danger.""

Meanwhile, other prominent commanders closed ranks with the high command, hitting back at Shyrshyn for going public.

In an unusually aggressive tone, the official page of Ukraine’s 425th Assault Regiment, better known as “Skala,” accused Shyrshyn of refusing to carry out orders.

“He (Shyrshyn) ignores the tasks assigned by higher leadership, leading to senseless losses among the personnel,” the post read.



“His leadership consistently ends in failure instead of results. The only thing he seems capable of is criticizing and shifting responsibility.""

“I believe that these posts represent the General Staff's response, they were made to order,” said SAS in reaction to Skala’s post.

“We fought together with Skala when they were still a small unit, we evacuated their wounded, we helped one another. I can't believe that a commander that has gone through that would let their communications team write that voluntarily.”

Having faced internal checks and investigations numerous times as part of the regular interactions between the brigade and the top brass, SAS expressed doubt that the General Staff’s response could bring anything positive.

""Inspections only show up to screw someone over — to find a flaw and punish someone for it. Not to fix it, not to improve the situation. These people are useless; it would be far better to send them to us as reinforcements instead.""

In his post online, Krotevych argued that even if Shyrshyn isn’t punished himself, it is unlikely that any meaningful changes will occur where they are most needed.

""When they find a scapegoat in the form of the brigade commander, the commander of the operational-tactical group, or the operational-strategic command — I won’t be surprised. The higher military leadership is not used to taking responsibility.""

Hi, this is Francis Farrell, thanks for reading this article.

Ukraine is set to pitch a larger number of recommendations to the European Union next week as to how the bloc can continue to ramp up economic pressure on Moscow through sanctions, Reuters reported on May 21.

The additional recommendations penned in the white paper come as U.S. President Donald Trump continues to refuse to adopt additional sanctions on Russia — even as Moscow continues to refuse to accept a 30-day ceasefire.

The New York Times reported on May 20, citing a White House official, that Trump refuses to impose sanctions on Russia as it may hinder future business and trade opportunities with Moscow.

Trump previously said the U.S. would join partners in imposing ""further sanctions"" if Russia does not agree to an unconditional ceasefire. Despite numerous threats, Trump has never followed through on imposing additional sanctions against Russia.

""Today, in practice, Washington has ceased participation in nearly all intergovernmental platforms focused on sanctions and export control,"" the white paper read, according to Reuters. ""On the contrary, it should catalyse the EU to assume a leading role in this domain.""

Reuters reported that Ukraine will propose to the EU that the bloc speed up the seizure of frozen Russian assets to provide to Kyiv. The additional proposed sanctions would also target foreign companies that assist Russia through the use of technology, and ""the introduction of secondary sanctions on purchasers of Russian oil"".

The proposal from Kyiv comes as EU members ponder the implementation of an 18th sanctions package against Russia.

Speaking to reporters in Brussels on May 20, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys said that harsher sanctions must be imposed as Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to reject a 30-day ceasefire proposal. Budrys further called on the EU to target Russia's energy, liquid natural gas (LNG), oil, and nuclear fuel exports as well as financial institutions.

President Volodymyr Zelensky echoed similar points in his evening address on May 20, calling for the EU to to apply additional sanctions on ""Russian oil, the tanker fleet, all their energy infrastructure that finances the war, all their banks, all financial schemes, and Russia’s military industry.""

In its pitch to the EU next week, Kyiv will also encourage the EU to make decisions on future sanctions through a majority vote, not unanimous decision.

In previous decisions, Hungary and Slovakia have attempted to block sanctions packages, citing their skepticism around support for Ukraine.

Politico reported on May 20 that the EU is shifting its focus away from providing development aid toward strategic goals like enforcing sanctions against Russia and building defense partnerships, with resources being redirected to match those priorities.

The United Kingdom has exposed a cyber campaign orchestrated by Russian military intelligence (GRU) targeting Western logistics and technology organizations involved in delivering foreign assistance to Ukraine, the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NSCS) announced on May 21.

According to a release by the NSCS, GRU Unit 26165, also known as APT 28, has been working to penetrate secure networks in the defence, IT, maritime, airports, ports and air traffic management systems across NATO countries, in an attempt to disrupt the logistics deliveries to Ukraine.

Russian hacker groups have engaged in various forms of cyber warfare throughout the full-scale war, including cyberattacks against Ukraine, hacks of civilian infrastructure in Europe, and interference in foreign elections.

Since 2022, the GRU unit, has been using different tactics, including credential guessing, spear-phishing, and exploiting Microsoft Exchange mailbox permissions, to get access into various secure networks linked to delivering support for Ukraine.

The Russian military intelligence unit would also target internet-connected cameras at Ukrainian border crossings and near military installations, the NCSC said.

""This malicious campaign by Russia’s military intelligence service presents a serious risk to targeted organisations, including those involved in the delivery of assistance to Ukraine,"" NCSC Director of Operations Paul Chichester said in a statement.

The unit, also known as 'Fancy Bear,' has previously caught the eye of other NATO allies.

On April 29, the French Foreign Ministry accused the unit of escalating cyberattacks against French ministries. France has brought charges against the GRU's APT28 unit — also known as 'Fancy Bear' — based in Rostov-on-Don in southern Russia.

No information was publicly provided as to whether the unit was able to obtain classified information, or what specific organizations were impacted by the breaches.

NATO allies the United States, Germany, Czech Republic, Poland, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, France and the Netherlands assisted the U.K. in exposing the cyber campaign, the NSCS said.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on May 21 agreed that Russia is an aggressor toward Ukraine, but declined to label Russian President Vladimir Putin as a war criminal.

U.S. President Donald Trump held a phone call with Putin on May 19. Trump's positive impression of the phone call shocked Ukraine's allies in Europe as Russia continues to refuse a ceasefire.

Democratic Representative Bill Keating asked Rubio, ""Is Russia the aggressor in this Ukraine war?""

""They invaded them, yes,"" Rubio said in response.

When asked by Keating if Putin is a war criminal, Rubio admitted war crimes have been committed in Ukraine, but declined to label the Russian leader as a war criminal.

""War crimes have been committed, no doubt, and who is responsible for that, there will be a time and place for that accountability, but right now the job is to end the war,"" Rubio said when questioned by the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Ukraine is working on a previously agreed-upon 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on May 21.

""We have to release all our people, unconditionally. We are trying to do the maximum we can. We are trying very hard,"" Zelensky said in an evening address on May 21.

Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) on May 17 announced it had launched preparatory steps for the large-scale prisoner exchange with Russia involving 1,000 detainees from each side.

Zelensky noted that Ukraine is ensuring the exchange goes as planned, adding that reports are prepared daily.

The prisoner exchange was agreed upon between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations at the Istanbul peace talks on May 16.

The peace talks were the first direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia since 2022, when Russia issued maximalist demands to Ukraine, including abandoning NATO membership aspirations and making large-scale territorial concessions.

The peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey led to an agreement on a prisoner exchange, but did not yield results in stopping Russia's war.

At the Istanbul talks, Russia sent a delegation of low-level officials and reiterated maximalist demands, including that Ukraine accept the loss of Crimea and four eastern regions.

Instead of a ceasefire, Russian President Vladimir Putin has insisted on negotiating a ""memorandum regarding a potential future peace treaty,"" the Russian leader said following a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump on May 19.

Ukrainian drones struck Russia's Bolkhov semiconductor plant in Oryol Oblast, which produces parts for Sukhoi warplanes and Iskander and Kinzhal missiles, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on May 21.

The statement comes after Russia claimed to have downed over 150 Ukrainian drones overnight in multiple regions, including 53 in Oryol Oblast.

The region's governor, Andrey Klychkov, initially reported no damage or casualties, but later said that the semiconductor plant and several residential buildings were damaged.

Ukrainian Telegram channel Supernova+ shared what it claimed to be footage of the burning and damaged facility.

Ten drones hit the plant's premises, resulting in a fire, the General Staff reported. The full consequences of the attack are being determined. The plant has been sanctioned by the U.S. since last year over its role in the Russian military-industrial complex.

The Bolkhov plant is one of Russia's leading producers of semiconductor devices and components, focusing on diodes, microcircuits, optoelectronic switches, and more, the General Staff said.

Putin visits Kursk Oblast for first time since Moscow claimed its recapture

Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Kursk Oblast, the Kremlin said on May 21, marking his first known visit since Moscow declared it had retaken the Russian border region from Ukrainian forces.

Russia claimed on April 26 that it had completed its operation to liberate Kursk Oblast. Ukraine has refuted the claim, saying that the fighting is ongoing in some areas.

During the visit, Putin met with Acting Governor Alexander Khinshtein, heads of local municipalities, and members of volunteer organizations. He also visited the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, the Kremlin's press service said. The exact date of the visit was not revealed.

The Russian president previously visited Kursk Oblast in March, which was his first trip to the region since Ukraine began its incursion last summer.

Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign forces since World War II. The operation aimed to disrupt a planned Russian offensive on the neighboring Sumy Oblast and draw Russian forces away from the embattled Donetsk Oblast.

Ukraine dismisses Russian claims of full control over Kursk Oblast, says fighting ongoing

The General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces dismissed on May 21 Russian claims that fighting in Russia's Kursk Oblast has ended, insisting that operations by the Ukrainian military in the border region are ongoing.

""The statements by representatives of (Russia) about the alleged end of combat operations in Kursk Oblast do not reflect the actual situation,"" the General Staff said in a statement.

Earlier on May 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly visited Kursk Oblast. It marked Putin's first known visit to the region since Moscow declared on April 26 that it had completed a military operation to liberate the territory from Ukrainian incursions.

Ukrainian forces continue to carry out missions across the border, the military said, adding that while conditions remain difficult, Ukrainian troops are holding their positions and inflicting losses on Russian troops.

Since launching its operation in Kursk Oblast, Ukraine claims Russia has lost 63,402 troops, including 25,625 killed, and that 971 Russian soldiers have been captured. Ukrainian forces also report destroying or damaging 5,664 pieces of Russian military equipment.

Russia massing troops near Kharkiv Oblast ahead of possible attack, military warns

Russia may be preparing to launch new attacks in the Kharkiv sector, as indicated by the buildup of its forces near the Ukrainian border, Andrii Pomahaibus, the chief of staff of Ukraine's 13th National Guard Khartiia Brigade, said on May 21.

Speaking to Suspilne, Pomahaibus said that Russia is trying to move its forces closer to the contact line, but has so far failed to carry out attacks.

The reported preparations indicate Moscow's efforts to escalate the war despite calls by Kyiv and its partners for an unconditional 30-day truce.

""There is an accumulation of personnel closer to the state border, that is, there are attempts to involve the (Russian) personnel, obviously preparing for active assault operations. Our Defense Forces are ready to repel attacks,"" he said.

NATO summit in The Hague to focus on long-term support, lasting peace for Ukraine, Rutte says

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on May 21 that the upcoming NATO summit in The Hague will focus on the military support for Ukraine to ensure it is in the strongest position possible both during its ongoing defense and in the eventual pursuit of a lasting peace, European Pravda reported.

Speaking at a joint press conference with Czech President Petr Pavel at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Rutte emphasized that all 32 NATO member states will discuss the continued support for Ukraine and how to avoid repeating past failed agreements.

""As for Ukraine, it will be a topic of discussion at the summit in The Hague. We must ensure that Ukraine, while the fight continues, receives all possible collective support to be in the best possible position to continue,"" Rutte said.

He added that when the time comes for peace, whether through a ceasefire or a formal agreement, it must be ""durable and sustainable.""

""We must make sure we never return to what we saw with the Minsk agreements,"" Rutte stressed, referring to the 2015 accords that failed to bring lasting peace to eastern Ukraine.

Rutte concluded by highlighting NATO's collective strength, saying, ""This will really show that NATO, composed of 32 countries with a combined economy of $50 trillion and defense spending at a high level, is truly capable of defending itself against any adversary.""

Ukrainian officials have dismissed on May 21 claims circulating online that Russian forces have reached the administrative border of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.

Serhii Lysak, head of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Military Administration, called the claims ""fake"" and said that the accompanying photograph allegedly showing Russian troops in the area was also fabricated.

""This so-called 'news' and the photo allegedly illustrating it do not reflect reality,"" Lysak said in a statement. ""They were deliberately published by (Russia) to frighten residents of our region, sow panic, and destabilize the situation.""

The Ukrainian monitoring group DeepState also addressed the viral image, which appeared to show Russian soldiers near a pickup truck entangled in barbed wire. Russian military bloggers claimed the photo proved they had reached the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast border near the village of Novomykolaivka.

DeepState refuted the claim, saying the photo was taken in the Donetsk Oblast village of Troitske and that the vehicle belonged to Ukrainian troops who came under attack during the night. Russian forces reportedly later arrived and staged photos with the abandoned vehicle in the morning.

There has been no official confirmation of any Russian advance into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.

While Donetsk Oblast has been the epicenter of Russia's aggression against Ukraine since 2014 — with significant escalation after the full-scale invasion in 2022 – Russian forces have not yet entered the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.

Moscow nevertheless regularly targets Dnipropetrovsk Oblast with drones, missiles, and aerial bombs, inflicting heavy civilian casualties.

Iran’s parliament has ratified a 20-year strategic partnership agreement with Russia, deepening ties between the two countries, Reuters reported on May 21.

The agreement, initially signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Jan. 17, was backed by the Russian parliament in April. The Iranian vote is the final legislative step before full implementation.

Iran has emerged as a key ally of Russia in its war against Ukraine, supplying Moscow with kamikaze drones and short-range ballistic missiles used in attacks on Ukrainian cities.

While the pact does not include a mutual defense clause, it outlines commitments for both countries to cooperate against common military threats, enhance military-technical collaboration, and participate in joint military exercises, according to Reuters.

Beyond military cooperation, the agreement includes provisions aimed at expanding economic ties. It encourages direct interbank collaboration and the promotion of national financial instruments, aiming to ease transactions and reduce reliance on Western banking systems.

Moscow has been Tehran's long-time ally, but their cooperation intensified after the outbreak of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022. Iran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed drones used in attacks against Ukrainian cities, as well as short-range ballistic missiles.

Reuters recently reported that Iran was preparing to send Russia Fath-360 short-range ballistic missile launchers with a range of 75 miles (120 kilometers).

With Iran's assistance, Russia has begun producing its own variants of Shahed drones called Geran-2.

Iran and Russia have also been at the forefront of confronting what they see as the Western-led global order, with Tehran sponsoring militant groups in the Middle East attacking the West's allies.

Their alliance suffered a major blow last December when Syrian rebels ousted dictator Bashar al-Assad, who was supported by both Russia and Iran.

Last June, Putin signed a similar partnership agreement with North Korea, under which both parties agreed to military support of each other in case of an armed attack. Months after the deal was signed, North Korea dispatched up to 12,000 troops to help fend off a Ukrainian incursion in Russia's Kursk Oblast.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1831273026.jpeg

The U.S. has achieved ""a lot of progress"" toward ending Russia's war in Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump said during a press briefing at the White House on May 21.

On May 19, Trump held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, marking their first known conversation in two months.

""We are trying to settle Russia-Ukraine,"" Trump told reporters. ""I spoke with President Putin for two hours the day before yesterday. I think we made a lot of progress. But that's a bloodbath.""

Trump described the war as ""a horrible thing.""

""There's a lot of hatred, a lot of deaths,"" he said. ""I get satellite pictures of that field — you never saw anything like that in your life.""

The recent call between two leaders came days after largely inconclusive negotiations in Istanbul, where Russia sent a delegation of low-level officials and reiterated sweeping territorial demands, including that Ukraine accept the loss of Crimea and four other regions.

After the call, Putin reiterated Russia's maximalist demands, denying full ceasefire agreement.

Trump has been inconsistent in his rhetoric toward the Russian leader, at times voicing frustration with the stalled peace efforts but mostly avoiding direct criticism of Putin.

Despite U.S. efforts, Putin has shown little willingness to compromise to achieve a settlement.

Trump's approach has caused frustration and confusion among European allies, many of whom wanted him to back a joint U.S.–EU ultimatum for an unconditional ceasefire starting May 12 and tougher sanctions on Moscow. Despite Russia's refusal, no additional U.S. sanctions have so far been imposed.

Trump has often boasted about his supposedly warm ties with the Russian leader, though the two have not met since Trump returned to office this January.

The two presidents previously held a phone call on March 18, during which Putin rejected Trump's Kyiv-backed offer for a 30-day ceasefire but declared a pause on strikes against energy facilities, which Ukraine said was repeatedly violated.

Trump has adopted a more critical rhetoric toward the Kremlin recently amid Moscow's delays in peace negotiations and continued attacks on civilian areas in Ukraine.

At the same time, the new U.S. administration has also often used a scathing tone toward Ukraine, most notably during an explosive meeting between Trump and Zelensky in the White House in February. The two leaders held a second meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis's funeral in April, which was described by both parties in more positive terms.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2177668198.jpg

The General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces dismissed on May 21 Russian claims that fighting in Russia's Kursk Oblast has ended, insisting that operations by the Ukrainian military in the border region are ongoing.

""The statements by representatives of (Russia) about the alleged end of combat operations in Kursk Oblast do not reflect the actual situation,"" the General Staff said in a statement.

Earlier on May 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly visited Kursk Oblast. It marked Putin's first known visit to the region since Moscow declared on April 26 that it had completed a military operation to liberate the territory from Ukrainian incursions.

Ukrainian forces continue to carry out missions across the border, the military said, adding that while conditions remain difficult, Ukrainian troops are holding their positions and inflicting losses on Russian troops.

Since launching its operation in Kursk Oblast, Ukraine claims Russia has lost 63,402 troops, including 25,625 killed, and that 971 Russian soldiers have been captured. Ukrainian forces also report destroying or damaging 5,664 pieces of Russian military equipment.

Active operations also continue in specified areas of Russia's neighboring Belgorod Oblast, according to the statement.

Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign forces since World War II. The operation aimed to disrupt a planned Russian offensive on the neighboring Sumy Oblast and draw Russian forces away from the embattled Donetsk Oblast.

Reinforced by North Korean troops, Russia launched a push to recapture the region in early March, with Ukraine being forced to pull back from much of the initially taken territory, including the town of Sudzha.

According to the Ukrainian monitoring group DeepState, Ukrainian forces still hold limited positions in the villages of Gornal and Oleshnya in Kursk Oblast.

Despite Moscow's declaration of victory in the region, Putin acknowledged on April 30 that ""remnants"" of Ukrainian forces are still in Kursk Oblast.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2166040844-1.jpg

As peace talks ramp up, experts and officials are already working on a looming post-war threat: the potential large-scale proliferation of guns in Ukraine once they are no longer needed on the battlefield.

""When the war ends, Ukraine will not only have to rebuild its infrastructure and resettle displaced people — it will also have to deal with collecting and disposing of vast quantities of arms and ammunition that were lost or abandoned by combatants on both sides, or stockpiled by civilians,"" said Nicolas Florquin, senior researcher and head of data and analytics for the Geneva-based independent research group Small Arms Survey.

Up until Russia’s full-scale invasion, only those approved for licenses could legally obtain a firearm. That changed once martial law was introduced on Feb. 24, 2022.

In Kyiv alone, during the first few days of the full-scale invasion, more than 25,000 automatic rifles and about 10 million bullets were handed out to civilians for Ukraine’s defense, according to public comments from then-Internal Affairs Minister Denis Monastyrsky.

As the war has dragged on for more than three years, new weapons have continued to pour into the country through government procurement and aid packages. The exact number is difficult to calculate from publicly available data, Florquin said, because of the many different sources and incomplete ways that shipments are often described in customs data, for instance.

And recently, sporadic headlines of shootings, like a case earlier this month in Kyiv where a man killed a soldier and his mother-in-law in a dispute over the illegal sale of a firearm, have raised concerns about whether illicit guns are spreading.

Yet fears — and Russian disinformation — about skyrocketing gun crimes or weapons leaking outside the border have so far failed to materialize. According to research conducted by the Small Arms Survey, access to firearms for the average civilian household has, in fact, decreased since 2022.

(Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)

""The active war at the front line is serving as a bit of a magnet for most of these weapons (because) they are needed at the front line, preventing any large-scale diversion both within Ukraine and to foreign countries,"" explained Florquin. Active efforts by the Ukrainian government to address the threat of weapons proliferation through searches and seizures are also helping to curb their spread, he added.

Meanwhile, around one in ten households with victims of recent crimes surveyed in 2024 said the incident had involved a firearm — a slight rise from prior surveys that Florquin described as ""something to watch"" but ""not yet alarming.""

""Obviously, the challenge will be to collect and dispose of excess weapons when and if this magnet effect of ongoing major conflict ceases,"" he added.

Steps for reform — but no new gun control law yet

Ukrainians may possess somewhere between one million and five million weapons, Internal Affairs Minister Ihor Klymenko stated last year.

Ukraine has already implemented some new gun control measures since the war broke out, and discussions with the Europan Union on the topic had started before the full-scale invasion as part of the required reforms for joining the bloc.

""If we talk about what the authorities are doing now, the government is largely guided by requests from international partners, particularly the European Union,"" said Viktoriia Voronina, executive director of the Center for Security Studies (CENSS) in Kyiv. ""For the European Union, arms control is one of the points they put as a priority.""

""Today, the issue of threats from illegal arms trafficking is more internal. Because weapons are found in playgrounds, weapons are found in apartments.""

One recent change is the June 2023 introduction of a unified registration system for firearm holders, though registration is currently voluntary.

While research from the Small Arms Survey indicates that awareness of the registry has grown among the public since it was launched, more than a third of Ukrainian households with firearms said they had not registered any of them a year later.

Another step has been the creation of a new coordination center to combat illegal trafficking of firearms, gun parts, and ammunition. The center, which had its first meeting in February and is headed by the Internal Affairs Ministry, acts in an advisory role and brings together multiple law enforcement agencies, ministries, and international organizations.

Although the coordination center has no decision-making authority, it has been useful for consultation and policy development, Voronina said. While these efforts were underway before, they have ""now acquired a more coordinated character.""

Yet perhaps the most important gun control reform step still hasn’t happened — passing a law on gun control.

Ukraine’s weapons controls are currently regulated by a parliamentary resolution, an Internal Affairs Ministry directive, and Ukraine’s criminal code, but proposed legislation giving citizens the right to carry certain firearms and regulating the practice has stalled in parliament for years. A draft of a gun control law passed its first parliamentary vote on the eve of the full-scale invasion, but has yet to pass a required second reading.

""The fact that we have not yet passed such a law for 30 years (of Ukrainian independence), I think, indicates that this is already a political issue,"" said Voronina.

Voronina’s work with CENSS conducting focus groups has shown that attitudes toward gun control vary by region, she explained. In regions of Kharkiv, for example, closer to the front-line fighting, Ukrainians were more likely to believe that weapons should only be carried by the military. In central Ukraine, they found that citizens were more likely to believe they should be allowed to carry weapons to defend themselves.

""It will be very difficult for us in Ukraine to identify some kind of unified opinion, a single basis for how we start a policy"" on weapons control, she said.

But while international discussion around Ukraine's arms control has focused primarily on risks of international trafficking, ""we currently do not have a very high percentage of weapons leaks abroad,"" Voronina said. ""Our law enforcement agencies keep this issue under high control. Today, the issue of threats from illegal arms trafficking is more internal. Because weapons are found in playgrounds, weapons are found in apartments.""

Florquin echoed her view that the domestic risks of unchecked proliferation — including its impact on violent crime, accidental discharges, and suicide within Ukraine — are higher than the risks posed to neighboring countries, which so far have not seen trafficking from Ukraine on any significant scale.

Small Arms Survey has been studying arms proliferation and violence in and around Ukraine since 2015, Florquin noted. ""What we're seeing is, those who will pay the greatest cost will be the Ukrainians. They will be the ones having to manage the challenge of arms proliferation and to pay most of the human cost.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-1659461512.jpg

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on May 21 that the upcoming NATO summit in The Hague will focus on the military support for Ukraine to ensure it is in the strongest position possible both during its ongoing defense and in the eventual pursuit of a lasting peace, European Pravda reported.

Speaking at a joint press conference with Czech President Petr Pavel at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Rutte emphasized that all 32 NATO member states will discuss the continued support for Ukraine and how to avoid repeating past failed agreements.

""As for Ukraine, it will be a topic of discussion at the summit in The Hague. We must ensure that Ukraine, while the fight continues, receives all possible collective support to be in the best possible position to continue,"" Rutte said.

He added that when the time comes for peace, whether through a ceasefire or a formal agreement, it must be ""durable and sustainable.""

""We must make sure we never return to what we saw with the Minsk agreements,"" Rutte stressed, referring to the 2015 accords that failed to bring lasting peace to eastern Ukraine.

Rutte concluded by highlighting NATO's collective strength, saying, ""This will really show that NATO, composed of 32 countries with a combined economy of $50 trillion and defense spending at a high level, is truly capable of defending itself against any adversary.""

The allies are set to gather for an annual summit in The Hague on June 24-25 amid growing uncertainties of the U.S.'s commitment to NATO under U.S. President Donald Trump.

Trump has been a long-time critic of the U.S.'s NATO partners and said he would not defend those that fail to meet defense spending targets, directly challenging the alliance's principle of collective defense.

The U.S. president has accused European countries of failing to contribute their fair share to the alliance's defense needs, and his administration has signaled that its strategic focus is shifting from Europe to the Indo-Pacific region.

NATO members have significantly increased their defense spending since Russia launched its full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022, with countries like Poland and the Baltic nations aiming to reach the 5% target in the coming years.

Previously, Italy's ANSA news agency reported that the U.S. is opposing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s participation at the upcoming NATO summit. According to Euractiv, allies have agreed that appeasing Trump takes priority and have not extended an invitation to Ukraine, a move NATO officials have not publicly confirmed.

U.S. State Secretary Marco Rubio later denied the U.S. opposed Zelensky's presence, telling reporters: ""No, I don't know where that's coming from.""

Ukraine has indefinitely postponed consideration of its draft law on virtual assets, despite earlier plans to bring it to a vote in parliament in early May.

A draft law aimed at legalizing virtual assets in Ukraine has been pulled from the legislative agenda following intervention by the Presidential Office, according to opposition MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak. The move reportedly came after National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC) Head Ruslan Mahomedov escalated his concerns to Presidential Office Head Andriy Yermak. Mahomedov reportedly demanded revisions to expand the commission’s role as regulator and insisted the draft be sent for additional review by the Security Service of Ukraine.

Around 49,000 draft-age men have been detained at border areas and checkpoints while trying to illegally cross Ukraine's border since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Andrii Demchenko, spokesperson for Ukraine's State Border Guard Service, said on May 21.

Ukraine prohibits men aged 18-60 from leaving the country under martial law, which was instituted at the outbreak of Russia's full-scale war in 2022.

Illegal border crossing schemes deepen the manpower shortages facing the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which then struggle to hold back the Russian advance at the front.

Nearly 45,000 individuals were detained in terrain-based border areas or at checkpoints along the border, while another 4,000 attempted to cross the border using fake documents and other illegal methods, according to the State Border Guard Service.

Speaking on air on national television, Demchenko clarified that the figures refer only to the period of martial law in Ukraine.

The State Border Guard Service actively cooperates with border guards from neighboring countries and the EU to jointly counter attempts to illegally cross the border, as the number of such cases has ""significantly increased"" since the beginning of martial law, the spokesperson added.

In January, the National Police uncovered nearly 50 schemes for draft-age Ukrainian men to illegally cross the border, charging 60 suspects.

Romania should continue supporting Ukraine, but without taking part in a potential peacekeeping force, Romanian President-elect Nicusor Dan said in an interview with Politico published on May 21.

""First, to have a big operational support on Romanian territory, yes. To be part of the armies guaranteeing peace in Ukraine, no,"" Dan told Politico when asked about Bucharest's possible involvement in the mission.

""I think it would not be very appropriate because of the tension that already exists between Romania and Russia.""

A potential deployment of international peacekeepers has been discussed within the British- and French-led coalition of the willing.

The ambitious plan, presented as a way to provide security guarantees to Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression, has eventually been scaled down over political disagreements and military capacity issues.

The EU has reached an agreement to launch a common defense fund of 150 billion euros ($170 billion) called SAFE, the Council of the EU announced on May 21.

""The more we invest in equipping our armies, the better we will deter those who wish us harm,"" the council said on X.

""SAFE is the first major EU program to increase investment in European defense capabilities, which becomes a reality.""

The move comes as Europe faces an increasingly challenging security environment, with Russia continuing to wage its war against Ukraine and U.S. security commitments to its European partners growing uncertain.

The new SAFE mechanism, proposed by the European Commission in March, will allow member states to borrow money from the EU to purchase weapons and military equipment.

EU members reached a preliminary agreement on the initiative on May 19, an EU official told the Kyiv Independent at the time. The program will be formally adopted on May 27.

""SAFE is an advantageous, low-interest, multi-year loan guaranteed by the EU budget,"" the council said.

""The program is also about simpler and accelerated procedures for joint defense procurement.""

Some non-EU countries will reportedly be able to participate in the program if their expenditures do not exceed 35% of the cost. Despite agreement on the need to hike defense spending, several EU states have previously disagreed on whether these efforts should be coordinated with nations outside of the bloc, such as the U.K. or Turkey.

A fire broke out at one of the facilities at the Bila Tserkva Thermal Power Plant, killing at least two people, the State Emergency Service reported on May 21.

The fire was reported around 1 p.m. local time, breaking out at one of the plant's facilities during repair work.

The fire was localized as of 2 p.m. Rescuers continue to work at the scene, while the consequences of the accident are still being determined, the statement read.

The Bila Tserkva Thermal Power Plant is one of Ukraine's critical infrastructure facilities that was severely damaged by a Russian attack in December 2022. Despite the damage, the plant continued to produce heat for residential buildings and civilian infrastructure in the region in the winters of 2023 and 2024.

In January 2024, the national commission that regulates the energy and utilities spheres suspended the plant's license due to the change of ownership.

Russia may be preparing to launch new attacks in the Kharkiv sector, as indicated by the buildup of its forces near the Ukrainian border, Andrii Pomahaibus, the chief of staff of Ukraine's 13th National Guard Khartiia Brigade, said on May 21.

Speaking to Suspilne, Pomahaibus said that Russia is trying to move its forces closer to the contact line, but has so far failed to carry out attacks.

The reported preparations indicate Moscow's efforts to escalate the war despite calls by Kyiv and its partners for an unconditional 30-day truce.

""There is an accumulation of personnel closer to the state border, that is, there are attempts to involve the (Russian) personnel, obviously preparing for active assault operations. Our Defense Forces are ready to repel attacks,"" he said.

In April, the Ukrainian military reported that Russian forces were regrouping and preparing for a renewed assault on Kharkiv Oblast. President Volodymyr Zelensky also said that Moscow had attempted to advance in Sumy Oblast, continuing its pressure on Ukraine's northeastern regions as part of what Kyiv described as a new spring offensive.

The Financial Times reported on May 13, citing undisclosed Ukrainian intelligence officials, that Russia seems to be preparing a significant offensive in Ukraine as it is moving troops toward key positions on the front.

A Ukrainian citizen has been charged following a series of arson attacks on property linked to U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the Times reported on May 21.

Petro Pochynok, 34, charged with conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life, is expected to appear at Westminster magistrates’ court on May 21.

Two properties and a car linked to Starmer were targeted in a fire on May 11, 12. The police said the property's entrance was damaged, but no one was injured, the Guardian reported on May 19.

""Due to the property having previous connections with a high-profile public figure, officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command have led the investigation into the fires,"" the London Metropolitan police said in a statement on May 15.

Previously, Roman Lavrynovych, also a Ukrainian citizen, and Stanislav Carpiuc, a Romanian citizen, were arrested.

Lavrynovych, 21, was charged on May 15. He worked as a model and a roofer.

He, on May 8, allegedly set a car that Starmer previously sold to a neighbour on fire.

On May 11, he allegedly set the front door of a home Starmer formerly lived in on fire, and on May 12, set a fire at Starmer's most recent home before moving to 10 Downing Street as U.K. Prime Minister.

Carpiuc, 26, a Russian-speaking Romanian national born in Ukraine, living in the U.K. for nine years, was also charged with conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life.

Washington also refused to label Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine as ""illegal"" in the text, according to sources who spoke to Politico.

This is not the first time that the U.S. has blocked joint G7 statements in support of Ukraine and condemning Russia's war.

Washington previously did not support a joint statement condemning Russia's deadly attack on Sumy, which killed 35 people and injured 119 on Palm Sunday on April 13. The Trump administration also opposed a joint statement on the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale war and vetoed a proposal for a task force tracking the Russian ""shadow fleet"" of tankers.

Since taking office in January, Trump has upended years of U.S. foreign policy on the Russia-Ukraine war, resuming direct contact with Moscow while exerting pressure on Kyiv by pushing for a peace agreement with Russia on conditions favorable to the Kremlin.

The U.S. Senate is ready to vote on a bill on sanctions against Russia if peace talks over the war in Ukraine do not progress soon, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham said on May 20, as Voice of America journalist Tetiana Vorozhko reported.

The U.S.-mediated negotiations between Ukraine and Russia have stalled, as Moscow continues to refuse a ceasefire and pushes its claims to four partially occupied Ukrainian oblasts — Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk, and Luhansk — and Crimea.

""If the next few days are like the last few months, then you can just count on us moving, because I think it's our job to try to help the world end this war,"" Graham said during the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations hearings.

""The Chinese are watching. This is a dress rehearsal for Taiwan. How this ends, I think, will greatly determine what happens with the future of Taiwan. And I want this war to end in a way that makes Xi (Jinping) think, 'Well, that didn't work out too well for (Vladimir) Putin,'"" the senator said.

Graham stressed that the war in Ukraine must end in a way that prevents a new one from starting.

""Afghanistan was a disaster. If we do not get this right in Ukraine, and the world perceives that Putin got away with it, that will be even worse. That will be worse than Afghanistan,"" he added.

The bill, introduced to the Senate in early April, would impose new penalties on Russia and slap 500% tariffs on imports from countries that buy Russian oil, petroleum products, natural gas, or uranium.

The bill, proposed by Graham and Senator Richard Blumenthal, was supported by 72 senators, a majority in the Senate, according to Graham.

Ukraine's European allies are tightening sanctions against Russia as Moscow refuses to cease fire.

Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Kursk Oblast, the Kremlin said on May 21, marking his first known visit since Moscow declared it had retaken the Russian border region from Ukrainian forces.

Russia claimed on April 26 that it had completed its operation to liberate Kursk Oblast. Ukraine has refuted the claim, saying that the fighting is ongoing in some areas.

During the visit, Putin met with Acting Governor Alexander Khinshtein, heads of local municipalities, and members of volunteer organizations. He also visited the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, the Kremlin's press service said. The exact date of the visit was not revealed.

The Russian president previously visited Kursk Oblast in March, which was his first trip to the region since Ukraine began its incursion last summer.

Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign forces since World War II. The operation aimed to disrupt a planned Russian offensive on the neighboring Sumy Oblast and draw Russian forces away from the embattled Donetsk Oblast.

Reinforced by North Korean troops, Russia launched a push to recapture the region in early March, with Ukraine being forced to pull back from much of the initially taken territory, including the town of Sudzha.

According to the Ukrainian monitoring group DeepState, Ukrainian forces still hold limited positions in the villages of Gornal and Oleshnya.

Various European leaders are calling on the European Union to implement harsher sanctions against Russia in the upcoming 18th sanctions package.

Speaking to reporters in Brussels on May 20, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys said that harsher sanctions must be imposed as Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to reject a 30-day ceasefire proposal.

""Deception, disruption, distraction, and delay, and the whole point of it is to avoid sanctions,"" Budrys said, in a likely reference to Putin's phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump that yielded no commitments to a ceasefire. ""We Europeans have to stop this vicious cycle and the instrument to stop it is to impose new sanctions.""

Budrys' comments come following the EU's adoption of the 17th package of sanctions against Russia on May 20, primarily targeting its shadow fleet of oil tankers.

Budrys further called on the EU to target Russia's energy, liquid natural gas (LNG), oil, and nuclear fuel exports as well as financial institutions.

Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said on May 19 on X that the next package of restrictions is ""already in motion.""

President Volodymyr Zelensky echoed similar points in his evening address on May 20, stating that the next sanctions package ""is already being prepared.""

Zelensky further called for the EU to to apply additional sanctions on ""Russian oil, the tanker fleet, all their energy infrastructure that finances the war, all their banks, all financial schemes, and Russia’s military industry.""

""A new European sanctions package — the 17th — is already in place. This is a step in the right direction, and there should be as many sanctioning steps as necessary for Russia to become interested in peace and to feel the full price of its aggression and desire to prolong the war,"" Zelensky said.

U.S. President Donald Trump refuses to impose sanctions on Russia as it may hinder future business and trade opportunities with Moscow, the New York Times (NYT) reported on May 20, citing a White House official.

Following a two-hour phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 19, Trump refused to adopt additional sanctions on Moscow, despite Putin again rejecting a 30-day ceasefire.

""I think there's a chance of getting something done, and if you do that, you could also make it much worse,"" Trump said, referring to implementing additional sanctions. ""But there could be a time where that’s going to happen,"" he added.

In a post on Truth Social following the call, Trump wrote that peace deal would be a ""tremendous opportunity for Russia to create massive amounts of jobs and wealth. Its potential is UNLIMITED.""

""Likewise, Ukraine can be a great beneficiary on Trade, in the process of rebuilding its country,"" he added.

Speaking to NYT on the condition of anonymity, a White House official familiar with the call, said that imposing sanctions could impede Trump's goal of ""maximizing economic opportunities for Americans,"" the publication wrote.

Trump on May 8 said the U.S. would join partners in imposing ""further sanctions"" if Russia does not agree to an unconditional ceasefire. Despite numerous threats, Trump has never followed through on imposing additional sanctions against Russia.

European leaders have urged the U.S. to impose additional sanctions on Russia to pressure it toward a ceasefire, with EU leaders threatening and subsequently adopting additional sanctions in response to Russia's ceasefire rejections.

On May 20 Axios reported that European leaders reportedly seemed ""surprised"" that Trump was ""relatively content"" with what he heard from Putin, following a call with European leaders after Trump's conversation with Putin.

When asked about potential sanctions against Russia, the U.S. president said he did not think it was a good idea, adding that he believes Putin wants a deal.

A senior European official familiar with closed-door discussion voiced European allies frustration with the lack of U.S. sanctions, telling NYT that Trump ""never seemed invested in joining sanctions on Russia,"" the publication wrote. Several other officials said that they did not expect Trump to implement additional sanctions in the immediate future.

Despite violating multiple short-term truces, Trump nonetheless has said Russia and Ukraine will be able to ""do big business"" with the United States if they secure a peace deal.

Frustrated by a lack of progress, Trump has also repeatedly threatened to ""back away"" from negotiations.

""I tell you, big egos involved, but I think something's going to happen. And if it doesn't, I just back away, and they're going to have to keep going,"" Trump said following his phone call with Putin.

The European Union is preparing to provide Radio Free Europe with a contract valued at 5.5 million euros ($6.2 million) in ""emergency funding"" to support the ongoing work of the media organization amid the Trump administration's funding cuts.

The funding, announced by the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas, will serve as ""short-term, emergency funding designed for the safety net for the independent journalism,"" Kallas said, and will be administered through the European Endowment for Democracy.

The announcement comes in response to cuts imposed to U.S.-backed media organizations by U.S. President Donald Trump.

On March 15, Trump signed an executive order slashing funding to seven government agencies, including the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM). The agency soon after issued a notice terminating a congressionally approved grant for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), freezing around $75 million already allocated for the 2025 fiscal year.

Following Trump's order, EU foreign minister expressed grave concerns about the situation with RFE/RL's funding, with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski confirming that the EU is considering options to help the media after the U.S. funding cutoff.

""We are at the stage of brainstorming, but clearly, these are worthy institutions whose mission should continue,"" Sikorski added.

Addressing reports that the EU may establish permanent funding for RFE/RL, Kallas said EU country must ""come in to find solutions for the long-term financing.""

""If we look at the total amount of funding that they have for operating all across the globe, then it is clear that Europe cannot step in with all this funding that is necessary. Our focus should be really to help Radio Free Europe to work and function in those countries that are in our neighbourhood,"" Kallas told reporters in Brussels. ""Like I said, it is the short-term financing.""

The media organization, established during the Cold War to challenge Soviet influence, operates as an independent media corporation funded by U.S. congressional appropriations through USAGM.

On May 7, following a legal challenge brought upon by RFE/RL, a U.S. court of appeals ruled on USAGM must release $12 million in funding previously approved by Congress, marking a significant victory for the media organization.

RFE/RL's broadcasts have long been a target of Kremlin ire. The outlet provides critical coverage of authoritarian governments, human rights abuses, and Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine.

The European Union is preparing to downsize its diplomatic service – the European External Action Service (EEAS) – and redirect funds toward strategic interests such as enforcing sanctions against Russia, POLITICO reported on May 20.

According to a document reviewed by POLITICO and confirmed by two officials familiar with the matter, the EU is scaling back operations at 10 foreign delegations and laying off around 100 local staff as part of budget reductions and a broader restructuring.



As part of the restructuring, delegations in countries linked to Russia's ""shadow fleet"" could see staff increases, according to one official familiar with the plans. Meanwhile, delegations in countries where the EU no longer sees a strong need for a large diplomatic presence, such as Belarus or Lesotho, will likely be targeted by budget reductions.

The same official said the EU is shifting its focus away from development aid toward strategic goals like enforcing sanctions and building defense partnerships, with resources being redirected to match those priorities.

The plan, proposed by Kaja Kallas, the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, was presented to senior European Commission officials on May 14 and has been approved for implementation over the next two years.

While the EU will not fully close down any of its 144 foreign delegations, around 10 will be reduced to core staff and local staff will be phased out.

Established in 2011, the EEAS has carried out the EU’s foreign policy to promote peace, prosperity, security, and the interests of Europeans across the globe. For more than a decade, it has primarily focused on development aid and economic cooperation.

Kallas noted that the decision to lift sanctions is ""reversible and conditional... on progress,"" while recognizing that ""there can be no peace without the path to economic recovery.""

""We all need a stable Syria,"" Kallas added. ""Is everything ideal there? No, it is not. It is very clear. But I think we need to give the Syrian people a chance.""

Following the ouster of Russian-backed dictator Bashar al-Assad in a rebel offensive in December 2024, Syria's new leader – President Ahmed al-Sharaa – has sought to reverse the country's geopolitical isolation and years of crippling international sanctions.

Earlier this month, al-Sharaa reportedly offered the United States a deal that would give American companies access to Syria's natural wealth, reminiscent of the minerals agreement Washington recently signed with Ukraine.

Writing on X, Kallas also expressed the EU's desire to help rebuild Syria after more than a decade of war.

""We want to help the Syrian people rebuild a new, inclusive and peaceful Syria,"" Kallas said. ""The EU has always stood by Syrians throughout the last 14 years - and will keep doing so.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2213279841.jpg

Washington, D.C. — In a rare display of bipartisan unity, a group of U.S. senators has introduced a resolution calling for the return of thousands of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia, urging that no peace agreement to end the war in Ukraine be finalized until all minors are safely repatriated.

The resolution condemns what it describes as Russia’s systematic abduction, forced transfer, and illegal deportation of Ukrainian children. It states that ""Russia's abduction and Russification of Ukrainian children demonstrate Russia's intent to erase the Ukrainian nation and identity.""

The effort is being led by a group of six senators, including Republicans Charles E. Grassley, Roger Wicker, Joni Ernst, and Rick Scott, and Democrats Amy Klobuchar, Dick Durbin and John Fetterman. The resolution underscores that the invasion of Ukraine has increased the vulnerability of children to multiple threats, noting that the ""invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation has significantly increased the risks of children being exposed to human trafficking and exploitation, child labor, sexual violence, hunger, injury, trauma, deprivation of education and shelter, and death.""

According to Ukrainian authorities, as of April 16, more than 19,500 children have been confirmed as unlawfully deported or forcibly transferred to Russia, Belarus, or areas of Ukraine under Russian occupation. So far, only 1,274 have been returned to Ukrainian-controlled territories.

The resolution frames the abduction of children as a violation of international humanitarian law and the Genocide Convention, citing Article 147 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and Article II(e) of the Genocide Convention, which prohibits the forcible transfer of children from one group to another.

The U.S. State Department’s 2024 Trafficking in Persons Report has also documented Russia’s recruitment of child soldiers and described the country as a global epicenter for state-sponsored human trafficking.

Razom for Ukraine, a U.S.-based nonprofit supporting Ukraine, has endorsed the resolution.

The organization stated, ""This is an important step in President Donald Trump's March 19 promise to ensure Ukrainian children abducted by Russia are returned to their families. By kidnapping over 19,546 children from Ukraine, Russia is simultaneously erasing these children's identities as Ukrainians while holding them hostage. The United States must say clearly that children are not bargaining chips and must be returned immediately.""

Ambassador John Herbst, senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center and former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said that ""Ukraine's kidnapped kids are counting on Congress and President Trump to insist that Moscow free them. Full stop.""

""According to available data, Russia has abducted more than 19,400 Ukrainian children since 2022 — an outrageous crime. Freeing Ukraine's children should be a prerequisite to any negotiations, and I thank President Trump for expressing his desire to help free Ukraine's children.""

Mykola Kuleba, CEO and founder of Save Ukraine and former ombudsman for children in Ukraine, emphasized the urgency of returning the children. ""As a nonprofit leader working to rescue and reunite these children with their families, I'm grateful for every voice raised on their behalf. We deeply appreciate leaders urging action to ensure that these children are safely returned with urgency,"" he said.

The resolution also references earlier remarks by former President Donald Trump, who has claimed he could persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to release the abducted children. ""President Trump promised...to help make sure those children were returned home,"" said Secretary of State Marco Rubio and then-National Security Advisor Mike Waltz at the time.

In 2022, Putin signed a decree that made it easier for Russian families to adopt Ukrainian children. The Russian government revised its adoption laws to fast-track the placement of abducted children with Russian families, often after stripping them of their names, language, and national identity.

The State Department’s Conflict Observatory reports that at least 35,000 children have been affected by these forced transfers. Researchers say the data is vital to Ukraine’s ongoing efforts to locate and repatriate abducted children.

In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Putin and Russian Children’s Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova for their roles in the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children. The United States has also sanctioned at least 32 individuals and three Russian entities for their involvement in these abductions and related human rights violations.

The bipartisan resolution signals that both Republican and Democratic lawmakers are united in condemning Russia’s actions and in demanding the immediate return of Ukraine’s children.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2149305400-1.jpg

Key developments on May 20:

'Russia is trying to buy time to continue the war' — Zelensky says after Putin-Trump call

EU approves 17th package of Russia sanctions, targets shadow fleet

Rubio says US, NATO seek more Patriot air defense systems for Ukraine

Kyiv to receive 400,000 more shells from Czech initiative, Ukraine's PM says

Trump administration considers deporting nearly 200,000 Ukrainians using foreign aid funds, WP reports

Russia is trying to buy time to continue the war in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on May 20, reacting to a recent call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Zelensky's statement follows his call with Finnish President Alexander Stubb, during which the Ukrainian leader told his counterpart about his May 19 phone call with Trump, as well as the latter's talks with Putin.

""It is obvious that Russia is trying to buy time to continue the war and occupation,"" Zelensky said on X. ""We are working with our partners to pressure the Russians to change their behavior.""

Zelensky thanked partners who continue to impose sanctions on Russia for its aggression in Ukraine and stressed that the war should end at the negotiating table.

""Clear and realistic proposals must be on the table. Ukraine is ready for any effective negotiation format. And if Russia continues to put forward unrealistic conditions and undermine possible results, there must be harsh consequences,"" Zelensky said.

Axios reported on May 20 that Zelensky had to remind Trump that negotiations with Russia are already underway after Trump announced to EU leaders the Kremlin's readiness for talks, citing sources present at the call.

The exchange reportedly took place during a phone call involving Trump, Zelensky, and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy, Finland, and the European Union.

It followed Trump's earlier call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which the Russian leader provided vague assurances about peace efforts but again rejected a ceasefire in Ukraine.

Trump told the leaders that Putin agreed to start direct negotiations on a ceasefire immediately, which led to a few seconds of ""puzzled silence"" during the call, Axios' source said.

Zelensky then reminded Trump that Putin had previously agreed to this, and the first round of direct talks had already taken place on May 16 in Istanbul, marking the first direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow since 2022. Trump did not directly respond, the sources said.

The Ukrainian president and other leaders also pointed out to Trump that it had been his idea to start the peace talks with an immediate 30-day ceasefire, according to Axios.

Participants on the call reportedly seemed ""surprised"" that Trump was ""relatively content"" with what he heard from Putin. Even though the Kremlin's position has not changed, Trump presented this as a new development in the negotiation process.

EU approves 17th package of Russia sanctions, targets shadow fleet

The EU has formally approved its 17th package of sanctions imposed on Russia over aggression in Ukraine, including measures against almost 200 shadow fleet vessels, top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas announced on May 20.

""New measures also address hybrid threats and human rights. More sanctions on Russia are in the works,"" Kallas said on X.

The step comes as the U.S. signals disinterest in imposing additional sanctions against Russia, even as Moscow refuses Western-backed ceasefire proposals.

The 17th package was supported by EU ambassadors last week, but has since then been criticized as weak and watered down.

The new sanctions target members of Russia’s military and political elite and foreign entities in China or the United Arab Emirates, accused of helping the Kremlin evade already-imposed measures.

The EU will also sanction more than 20 entities and individuals disseminating disinformation, and 20 judges and prosecutors involved in legal cases against Russian opposition, specifically Vladimir Kara-Murza and late Alexei Navalny.

The package also targets components vital to Russia’s defense industry, namely chemicals, materials, and dual-use goods.

The EU has threatened Russia with additional sanctions unless President Vladimir Putin commits to a ceasefire and agrees to seriously engage in peace efforts. President Volodymyr Zelensky also announced that a new ""strong EU sanctions package"" is underway.

While European leaders have proclaimed that additional sanctions are coordinated with Washington, U.S. President Donald Trump, who held a phone call with Putin on May 19, said he does not intend to impose new measures on Moscow to avoid disrupting peace efforts.

Rubio says US, NATO seek more Patriot air defense systems for Ukraine

The United States is working with NATO partners to locate additional Patriot air defense systems for Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on May 20 during Senate testimony on the State Department's budget.

Ukraine has consistently warned that its current air defense capacity is insufficient to counter the scale of Russia's intensified missile and drone attacks.

""The U.S. is looking for Patriot batteries to be able to transfer from other NATO nations into Ukrainian hands,"" Rubio told lawmakers, adding that no country is willing to give up these systems, and the U.S. cannot produce them quickly enough.

Kyiv has requested more Patriots to shield cities and critical infrastructure.

In an April 13 interview with CBS News, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine is ready to buy 10 U.S.-made Patriot systems for $15 billion.

""We will find the money and pay for everything,"" he said.

Despite Kyiv's appeals, U.S. President Donald Trump dismissed the request, accusing Zelensky of ""always looking to purchase missiles"" and falsely blaming Ukraine for provoking the war.

The Patriot is a high-precision, U.S.-made surface-to-air missile platform capable of intercepting aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic threats. Zelensky has repeatedly said Ukraine needs at least seven more systems to defend its most at-risk regions.

The New York Times reported on May 4, citing unnamed U.S. officials, that a Patriot system currently based in Israel will be transferred to Ukraine following refurbishment. Western allies are also reportedly reviewing whether to reallocate systems from Germany or Greece.

Kyiv currently operates eight Patriot systems, though only six are functional, with two undergoing repairs, according to the publication.

Ukraine accepted a U.S.-proposed 30-day unconditional ceasefire back in March.

Moscow has continued its large-scale drone and missile strikes, including the largest drone assault of the war on May 18, when 273 drones entered Ukrainian airspace.

Kyiv to receive 400,000 more shells from Czech initiative, Ukraine's PM says

Ukraine will receive 400,000 additional artillery shells in 2025 through the Czech-led munitions initiative, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on May 20 on Telegram.

The initiative, supported by contributions from Canada, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, and other nations, has significantly enhanced Ukraine's artillery capabilities. Launched in 2024, it has become a vital supplement to the country's firepower amid shell shortages.

Following a meeting with Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala, Shmyhal said Ukraine received around 1.5 million artillery shells of various calibers through the initiative in 2024.

He announced that Czechia has increased its annual aid allocation to Ukraine to over $43 million. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Prague has provided $900 million in military assistance to Kyiv.

Fiala and Shmyhal also discussed expanding cooperation on weapons production, economic support, and humanitarian assistance.

""We will strengthen the integration of the Ukrainian and Czech defense industries,"" Shmyhal wrote. ""In addition, we agreed to cooperate in training Ukrainian pilots of F-16 airplanes.""

Czechia has played a leading role within the EU in rallying military support for Ukraine and has hosted hundreds of thousands of refugees since the start of the war.

The country's opposition party, ANO, has threatened to suspend the munitions initiative if it wins parliamentary elections in October 2025.

ANO deputy leader Karel Havlicek made the remarks in January, raising concerns about the future of one of Ukraine's most reliable arms pipelines.

Trump administration considers deporting nearly 200,000 Ukrainians using foreign aid funds, WP reports

Washington plans to spend about $250 million of foreign aid funds to repatriate people from active conflict zones, including about 200,000 Ukrainians and 500,000 Haitians, the Washington Post reported on May 20, citing the draft internal documents the newspaper obtained.

During Joe Biden's presidency, Ukrainians and Haitians were granted temporary protection, allowing them to stay in the U.S. if they could not return to their home country.

With the Trump administration coming to office, the U.S. has tightened its immigration policy. U.S. President Donald Trump previously pledged to impose harsher legislation on migrants and launch the ""largest deportation program in U.S. history,"" aimed at removing 15 to 20 million migrants from the country.

According to the draft internal documents, the proposal was prepared after the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement on May 5. The statement read that those immigrants who voluntarily leave the U.S. for their home countries would be eligible for $1,000 in assistance.

Besides Ukrainians and Haitians, the draft documents also mention Afghans, Palestinians, Libyans, Sudanese, Syrians, and Yemenis, who could become other targets of the deportation program, the WP reported.

Tricia McLaughlin, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, verified the documents' authenticity, but described them as ""outdated."" McLaughlin added that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has not made a ""final"" decision on temporary protected status for Haiti or Ukraine.

According to the draft documents reviewed by the newspaper, the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) will fund the voluntary resettlement program using funds allocated by Congress for charter flights or commercial airfare.

The State Department has acknowledged that it is working with the Department of Homeland Security to provide ""travel support and financial incentives"" to encourage migrants to leave the country voluntarily.

The Trump administration's proposal has been criticized, including by former government officials who called it inhumane and counter to long-held U.S. ideals, the WP reported.

According to the plan's opponents, the Trump administration is forcing asylum seekers to return to countries where they are ""at risk of being killed."" They also questioned whether the plan constitutes an abuse of foreign aid funds intended primarily to support refugees and their resettlement.

In late January, Washington suspended acceptance of applications from Ukrainians for asylum under the Uniting for Ukraine program. This program allowed for two years of asylum in the U.S., as well as the right to work, study, and have health insurance, among other benefits.

There are about 200,000 Ukrainian refugees in the U.S., according to the United Nations.

After a two-hour call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russia reiterated its refusal for a full ceasefire in the war in Ukraine while the U.S. once again failed to respond with any significant pressure.

For observers across Europe, watching the way the negotiations have been unfolding was an unpleasant reminder that the U.S. can no longer be relied on as a partner — but it was not a surprising revelation.

""Chewing the same gum which has lost its taste is not the best experience,"" Mykola Bielieskov, Research fellow at Ukraine’s National Institute for Strategic Studies, told the Kyiv Independent.

Frederic Petit, a French National Assembly deputy, was similarly underwhelmed by the information shared about the call.

""It gives nothing, because of all the contradicting signals that are coming from the Kremlin and also a few of them are coming from the Trump administration,"" he told the Kyiv Independent.

""For example, about the business deal that (they) could do together — does it mean, Mr. President, that you will shift the sanctions or not?""

The phone call, which took place on May 19 after a conversation between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky, was followed by another call between Trump and other European leaders, including the Ukrainian president.

According to Zelensky, during his phone call with Trump, he advocated for a ceasefire, for the opportunity to express views on a potential memorandum that will be negotiated between the U.S. and Russia, and for decisions about Ukraine not to be made without his country’s inclusion.

But Russia did not back down from its maximalist demands during the call, according to statements from officials. It has repeatedly demanded that Ukraine hand over more territory than Russia currently controls — a non-starter for Ukraine and a condition that has been a roadblock in negotiations.

'Imitating negotiations'

Throughout the peace process that began when Trump took office in January, Trump has repeatedly put heavy pressure on Ukraine to make concessions to Russia, while refusing to apply similar tactics to Russia.

As information about the discussions reached experts across Europe, it was yet another of many reminders since Trump’s election that Europe will need to be more self-reliant.

""Russia is prepared for a prolonged war and is currently not thinking about peace,"" Eitvydas Bajarunas, ambassador at Lithuania's Foreign Ministry and visiting fellow at the Center for Europe Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent.

""Clearly, Russia would prefer a short pause to catch its breath, and ideally, to see some sanctions lifted. At the same time, Putin doesn’t want to discourage Trump, so he will continue to respond positively to Trump’s requests to consider ending hostilities — though only by imitating negotiations.""

Bajarunas also noted that negotiations for peace in Ukraine have fallen in priority for Washington.

Having failed to deliver on a campaign promise to end the war within 100 days, Trump again threatened on May 19 to abandon efforts to end the war if progress was not made towards a peace deal.

""Europe can do more, but is choosing to hope for either Putin or Trump changing their minds.""

""In this context, I see only one solution. Europe must take responsibility and lead the way — impose sanctions on Russia, supply weapons to Ukraine, and offer a concrete peace plan,"" Bajarunas said.

""Time to wake up. It’s now or never,"" he added.

The subsequent phone call with European leaders was one positive sign, said Yohann Michel, a senior research fellow at the defense research institute IESD in Lyon.

""This time, he's calling the Europeans and we might actually have the Europeans at the table,"" Michel said. ""Instead of having bilateral or trilateral talks somewhere where we are out of the room and out of the situation, we might actually be able to participate directly.""

Yet Michel also added that Trump’s stance has shifted frequently and previous positive signals have been sometimes short-lived.

""My first reaction was to think, okay, there we go again. Trump had a different conversation with someone else. Therefore, he will now completely change his representation and understanding of the issue.""

'Everyone is playing their part in this charade'

Europe has repeatedly called for ramped-up support to Ukraine as the new U.S. administration has signaled its unwillingness to continue providing aid to Kyiv.

""While discussions about European-led peacekeeping or security assistance are still in early stages — and would be complicated without U.S. backing — the UK and its allies are beginning to think seriously about what a more self-reliant European response might look like,"" said Ievgeniia Kopytsia, a legal expert and visiting research fellow at the University of Oxford.

The day after Trump and Putin spoke, the EU approved its 17th package of sanctions against Russia, including measures against Russia’s ""shadow fleet"" of oil tankers, which the country uses to break embargoes and sustain its economy.

""More sanctions on Russia are in the works,"" top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas said on X, announcing the package.

But for many, Europe’s measures fall short of the moment.

""Trump is constantly surprising everyone by how he manages to help Putin justify continuing his aggression. And everyone (Ukrainians and Europeans) is playing their part in this charade,"" Gabrielius Landsbergis, former Lithuanian Foreign Minister, told the Kyiv Independent.

""Europe can do more, but is choosing to hope for either Putin or Trump to change their minds.""

One step Europe could take would be to quickly unfreeze Russian assets that have been seized and transfer the money to Ukraine, Evelyn Farkas, executive director of the McCain Institute, told the Kyiv Independent.

""They can ramp up their production of drones. That's not the only thing they need, of course. They need training. Europeans could come in and train again, especially if more air defense is provided.""

""But there is not a sufficient sense of urgency,"" she said. ""It's bad enough that the United States doesn't understand that we're on war footing. But the fact that the Europeans don't understand that is really distressing.""

Dementiy Bilyi, a 56-year-old political scientist and local historian, has watched Europe’s response from Kherson, a city which remained under Russian occupation for 256 days from February to November 2022 before it was liberated during the Kherson counteroffensive.

Bilyi is trying to keep in touch with people on the Russian-occupied left bank of Kherson Oblast, who keep him informed about the information space in the area, which the Kremlin dominates.

""Many Russian Telegram channels are created in the occupied part of the Kherson region. They often try to spread the narrative that Russia will come back here,"" he said.

""People are tired; they need support. They need to hear words of support from our European partners and allies. This helps them not to lose hope.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2215368313.jpg

George Simion, leader of Romania's far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), announced on May 20 that he will appeal the results of the May 18 presidential election, despite conceding defeat to pro-EU candidate Nicusor Dan.

Dan, the mayor of Bucharest, secured 53.6% of the vote in the runoff, defeating Simion's 46.4%, according to Romania's electoral authority.

The result signals a rejection of Simion's anti-Ukraine, nationalist platform and comes amid renewed scrutiny of foreign influence in Romanian politics.

""I officially ask the Constitutional Court to annul the Romanian presidential elections for the same reasons the December elections were annulled: external interferences by state and non-state actors,"" Simion wrote on X.

Simion cited a post from Telegram CEO Pavel Durov, who claimed a ""Western European government"" asked the company to restrict ""conservative voices in Romania.""

""The testimony of the founder of Telegram... is revealing. I demand his testimony before the elections are recognized as valid,"" Simion said, also accusing Moldova of facilitating ""electoral tourism"" that unfairly benefited his opponent.

Romania's previous presidential election, held in November 2024, was annulled by the Constitutional Court following evidence of foreign manipulation, including pro-Russian disinformation campaigns.

That vote was won by populist candidate Calin Georgescu, who openly promoted conspiracy theories and described Ukraine as a ""fictional state.""

Simion has faced criticism throughout the campaign for pro-Kremlin rhetoric and repeated calls for Ukraine to compensate Romania for its aid.

During a May 8 debate, he argued, ""Ukraine needs us, we don't need Ukraine,"" and labeled the donation of a Patriot missile system to Kyiv as ""national treason.""

In contrast, Dan has pledged to continue Romania's support for Ukraine, strengthen ties with the EU, and uphold democratic institutions. Following the vote, President Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated Dan in a call on May 19.

""We respect Romania and the choice of the Romanian people. This is a country on which much depends when it comes to security issues,"" Zelensky posted on X. ""It is important that support for Ukraine continues.""

Bucharest has played a critical role in Ukraine's defense, signing a bilateral security pact with Kyiv, facilitating grain exports, and providing key air defense systems.

Zelensky invited Dan to Ukraine for talks, noting the ""nearest opportunities for us to meet.""

In what is now a semi-regular occurrence, the workings of U.S.-led global diplomacy has cast a dark shadow over Ukraine.

U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on May 19 in the latest attempt to broker a ceasefire in Ukraine. The call came just days after a U.S.-backed but largely inconclusive negotiation between Kyiv and Moscow, where Russia sent a delegation of low-level officials and reiterated sweeping territorial demands.

Following the call, Trump told reporters that he trusts Putin, will not sanction Russia, but will abandon Ukraine peace efforts if progress is not made.

In a follow-up call between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky, the latter had to remind his U.S. counterpart that negotiations with Russia are already underway and that Moscow has been stalling all efforts to impose a ceasefire.

""It is obvious that Russia is trying to buy time to continue the war and occupation,"" Zelensky later wrote on X.

Yet the tone coming from the White House after the call suggested that at least to one man, it wasn't that obvious at all.

""Nothing good is expected,"" Yelyzaveta Yasko, a lawmaker from the governing Servant of the People party, told the Kyiv Independent when asked for her initial reaction to the phone conversations.

The results of the Trump, Putin call

Despite the U.S. president claiming ""it went very well,"" that ""some progress was made,"" and that the ""tone and spirit of the conversation was excellent,"" Ukraine and its European allies were stunned by the outcome of Trump's call with Putin.

Trump also claimed that Putin had agreed to ""immediately start negotiations towards a ceasefire,"" seemingly forgetting that he himself has been demanding one since March 11, and that direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are already underway.

According to Axios, when Trump told Zelensky and other European leaders about the results of the call, he was met with a stunned silence.

Once this had passed, Zelensky had to gently remind Trump that it had been his idea all along to start the peace talks with an immediate 30-day ceasefire.

""Putin has humiliated him in public several times in a row, and the U.S. president doesn't want to recognize that and doesn't know what to do.""

In addition, Russia once again refused to agree to the ceasefire, instead saying it was prepared to negotiate a ""memorandum regarding a potential future peace treaty.""

Neither Trump nor Putin discussed a deadline for a ceasefire, and the U.S. president once again threatened to walk away if Ukraine and Russia could not negotiate a peace between themselves, effectively giving Putin free rein to continue waging war against Ukraine.

In Kyiv, the news was met with a now familiar mix of resignation, disappointment, and increasing unease over Trump's continuing appeasement of Putin's position.

""The main conclusion of the latest phone conversation between Trump and Putin is that Trump doesn't know how to deal with real gangsters,"" Andrii Osadchuk, a lawmaker from the Holos faction, told the Kyiv Independent.

""Putin has humiliated him in public several times in a row, and the U.S. president doesn't want to recognize that and doesn't know what to do.""

Of particular concern is the idea that future negotiations should be conducted solely between Russia and Ukraine, without a mediator, and that Trump appears to perceive his attempts at brokering a peace as bearing fruit, despite Russia not having budged from the demands it set way back in 2022.

""The fact that Americans believe that peace can be achieved through direct conversations is a dangerous sign,"" Inna Sovsun, a lawmaker from the Holos faction, told the Kyiv Independent.

""The Russians are only willing to negotiate and compromise if there is some pressure on them that they feel.""

Any hopes of the U.S. placing its first real pressure on the Kremlin since Trump took office was swiftly quashed by the U.S. president — immediately after the call he told reporters at the White House that he will not impose further sanctions against Russia ""because there's a chance"" of progress towards a ceasefire.

The view from Ukraine, however, is very different.

""Ukraine, through years of dealing with Russia, has learned one very clear lesson: Putin constantly lies,"" Halyna Yanchenko, a lawmaker from the Servant of the People party, told the Kyiv Independent.

""Today, he continues to use the same tactic — trying to blind Donald Trump, stall for time, and use any pause to seize even more Ukrainian territory,"" she added.

Russia's demands

Underpinning the intense feeling of frustration in Ukraine is a fact that appears obvious to almost everyone except Trump — that after 119 days, Putin has not made a single concession that suggests he is truly interested in peace.

""This phone call hasn't changed anything at all,"" Oleksandr Merezhko, a Ukrainian lawmaker and chair of the parliament's foreign affairs committee, told the Kyiv Independent.

""Putin continues to insist on his ultimatums and maximalist demands, and keeps rejecting ceasefire proposals.""

At the May 15 Istanbul talks, Russia sent a delegation of low-level officials and reiterated maximalist demands, including that Ukraine accept the loss of occupied Crimea and four oblasts in their entirety despite Russia not fully controlling any of them.

""I will continue to resist even if Crimea remains part of Russia, because Crimea was and is Ukraine, regardless of political decisions.""

Attacks against civilians have only escalated since Trump took office, and on May 18, Russia carried out its largest drone attack since the start of its full-scale invasion.

Trump, the author of ""The Art of the Deal,"" once again trumpeted his alleged negotiating skills when telling reporters on May 19 about his call with Putin.

""My whole life is like deals — one big deal,"" he said.

In the context of his failed peace process in Ukraine so far, the claim rang hollow.

""The stance of the EU and the U.S. was to step up pressure on Russia if it rejects a ceasefire,"" Olena Halushka, a board member at the Anti-Corruption Action Centre (AntAC), told the Kyiv Independent.

""It rejected it, so now it's time to act — step up sanctions and military aid, and confiscate frozen Russian assets. Russia doesn't want peace, it wants Ukraine,"" she added.

On May 20, the EU kept up its side of the bargain, formally approving its 17th package of sanctions imposed on Russia over aggression in Ukraine, including measures against almost 200 shadow fleet vessels.

To date, Trump has not taken a single concrete action to place any pressure on the Kremlin.

The cost of failed negotiations

While phone calls, negotiations, and Truth Social posts play out on the global stage, those with perhaps the most at stake — Ukrainians living under Russian occupation — watch on.

""I am worried that as a result of the negotiations, Crimea may be left under Russian control,"" a woman currently living in occupied Crimea, whose name is being withheld for security reasons, told the Kyiv Independent on May 19.

She is an activist with the Yellow Ribbon resistance movement, fighting back against Russian occupation because she wants the ""world to see that Ukrainians here have not surrendered.""

""I will continue to resist even if Crimea remains under Russian rule, because Crimea was and is Ukraine, regardless of political decisions,"" she added.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2214408470.jpg

My daughter is just over a year old. She’s learning to walk, says a few words in both Ukrainian and English, and because of Russia’s war, she already has an acute understanding of what it means to be afraid.

The first time she reacted to the air raid siren, she was playing in her crib while I tidied up the bedroom. She’d never paid attention to it before, so I didn’t expect anything to happen when it started. But that time, she cried out, “Mama!” with her arms outstretched, eyes wide, on the verge of tears.

As I always say, we’re “lucky” compared to so many others. For the past three years, Chernivtsi Oblast has been mostly spared from Russian missile and drone strikes. I can’t imagine what it’s like for mothers in cities like Kyiv, Kharkiv, or Kherson — trying not only to keep their children physically safe, but also to safeguard them against lifelong psychological trauma.

Yet, every time I have to calm her as her breathing quickens in a panic at the sound of the air raid siren, I can’t help but wish there were a magic switch to make Russia disappear.

I start to worry that this war will drag on so long that my daughter will grow old enough to remember it — that war will become part of her learned experience, part of what shapes her. And when I think about that, I’m still stunned that there are people in this world who can harm children without regret.

Maybe it’s naive, but I can’t understand how anyone who’s been blessed with a child could still choose to bring harm to others. How can they greet their own children at the end of the day knowing they’re responsible for missile and drone strikes that have killed children, orphaned them, and left them permanently disabled? How can they take tens of thousands of children from their families, send them to the farthest corners of Russia for “adoption,” and be deranged enough to think they are saving them?

Over 19,500 children have been officially identified as missing by the Ukrainian government, with only around 1,300 returned home from Russian-controlled territory.

As an American living for many years in Ukraine, I’m also deeply saddened that the plight of Ukrainian children hasn’t resonated more with American policymakers — especially the right wing. Republicans in particular tend to stoke moral panic over issues like human trafficking. Well, here is one of the most blatant examples of it in recent memory: over 19,500 children have been officially identified as missing by the Ukrainian government, with only around 1,300 returned home from Russian-controlled territory.

The actual number of Ukrainian children forcibly taken by Russia is likely much higher, and there is a very real and heartbreaking possibility that not all of them will be found if not all the necessary resources are put into guaranteeing their return.

Russia is exploiting the vulnerability of many of the Ukrainian children in their custody, manipulating impressionable young minds to militarize them and instill hatred for their homeland. They are training Ukrainian children to become the Russian soldiers of tomorrow, ultimately viewing them as expendable tools in their campaign of terror.

Generally speaking, misfortune befalls anyone who belongs in the margins of Russian society. From the accounts of older Ukrainian children who understood what was happening to them and did everything they could to escape, we know they are being subjected to various forms of abuse.

Without its children, Ukraine as a nation — not just a place on a map — cannot survive.

What Russia is doing to Ukraine’s stolen children is not just a political matter — it is an issue of the greatest moral urgency. That’s why His Holiness Pope Leo XIV, in his first Sunday address since becoming leader of the Holy See, called for the return of these children to their homeland.

Ukraine’s greatest natural resource isn’t minerals found underground — it’s found in classrooms, playgrounds, and family kitchens. It’s the children. They are the living thread connecting Ukraine’s past to its future, the ones who will carry forward the language, the history, the cultural traditions. No monument or archive can safeguard Ukraine’s identity the way its children can.

That’s why even losses on a smaller scale than the daily death and destruction matter, too.

When a Ukrainian child whose family fled as refugees begins to feel more at home in the language or identity of their host country, something precious is at risk of being lost forever. The tragedy of war isn’t only measured in lives lost or cities destroyed — it’s in this quiet erosion of cultural identity too. Because without its children, Ukraine as a nation — not just a place on a map — cannot survive.

It will fall to these young Ukrainians, including my own daughter, to one day rebuild what has been shattered by Russia’s war. They will be the ones who decide whether Ukraine becomes a vibrant, prosperous, and secure nation — one strong enough to ensure such a horrific war never happens again. But that future is only possible if Ukraine’s children are given the chance to return home, to thrive, and to dream in a peaceful country. It can’t happen if their parents see that it’s too dangerous to return home, they’re trapped alone in Russian-controlled territory, or they're dead.

Since the start of the full-scale war in 2022, I’ve often wondered about the true definition of evil. The closest answer I’ve found since becoming a mother is this: it’s those who deliberately harm and destroy the lives of innocent children.

Hungarian intelligence services have uncovered two alleged Ukrainian ""spies,"" Hungarian government spokesperson Zoltan Kovacs wrote on the social media platform X on May 20.

The new allegations escalate a diplomatic row sparked by mutual espionage accusations between Kyiv and Budapest.

Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) claimed on May 9 that it had exposed a Hungarian espionage network in western Ukraine, detaining two agents. In response, Hungary expelled two Ukrainian diplomats, a move met with reciprocal expulsions by Kyiv.

Kovacs said that Hungary's Fidesz party identified the individuals as Roland Tseber and Istvan Hollo.

Citing the parliamentary group leader Mate Kocsis, he claimed Tseber was ""an illegal officer of Ukrainian intelligence"" who built ties with opposition figures to influence Hungary's position on Russia's war.

Kocsis also claimed Hollo was a Ukrainian national under investigation for seeking classified Hungarian information on energy and military policy.

""This activity fits a classic influence operation aiming to discredit Hungary internationally and pressure the government to shift its Ukraine policy,"" Kocsis said.

Ukraine hasn't commented on the latest allegations.

On May 13, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban accused Ukraine of meddling in Hungary's internal affairs and colluding with an opposition party.

""The Hungarian opposition party took an active part in the special operation of the Ukrainian secret service. Such a thing has never happened in our memory,"" Orban said, likely referring to the Tisza party led by opposition figure Peter Magyar.

Magyar, who visited Kyiv in July 2024 and raised humanitarian aid for Ukraine, has positioned his party in opposition to Orban's policies and vowed to reset Hungary's relations with the West.

Orban, widely regarded as the EU's most pro-Russian leader, has repeatedly opposed military aid for Ukraine and warned that Ukraine's EU membership would ""destroy"" Hungary.

The United States is working with NATO partners to locate additional Patriot air defense systems for Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on May 20 during Senate testimony on the State Department's budget.

Ukraine has consistently warned that its current air defense capacity is insufficient to counter the scale of Russia's intensified missile and drone attacks.

""The U.S. is looking for Patriot batteries to be able to transfer from other NATO nations into Ukrainian hands,"" Rubio told lawmakers, adding that no country is willing to give up these systems, and the U.S. cannot produce them quickly enough.

Kyiv has requested more Patriots to shield cities and critical infrastructure.

In an April 13 interview with CBS News, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine is ready to buy 10 U.S.-made Patriot systems for $15 billion.

""We will find the money and pay for everything,"" he said.

Despite Kyiv's appeals, U.S. President Donald Trump dismissed the request, accusing Zelensky of ""always looking to purchase missiles"" and falsely blaming Ukraine for provoking the war.

The Patriot is a high-precision, U.S.-made surface-to-air missile platform capable of intercepting aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic threats. Zelensky has repeatedly said Ukraine needs at least seven more systems to defend its most at-risk regions.

The New York Times reported on May 4, citing unnamed U.S. officials, that a Patriot system currently based in Israel will be transferred to Ukraine following refurbishment. Western allies are also reportedly reviewing whether to reallocate systems from Germany or Greece.

Kyiv currently operates eight Patriot systems, though only six are functional, with two undergoing repairs, according to the publication.

Ukraine accepted a U.S.-proposed 30-day unconditional ceasefire back in March.

Warning: This article contains descriptions of graphic scenes.

A bullet fired by a Russian sniper hit Azov Brigade member Artem Dubyna in the head and passed through his neck. ""He's dead,"" crackled the message over the radio to his comrades.

But Dubyna's heart was still beating.

Evacuating his unconscious body from the spot where he was shot — inside the Azovstal steel plant, Ukraine's final stronghold during the Russian siege of Mariupol in the spring of 2022 — was nearly impossible amid relentless Russian bombardment.

As he began to show faint signs of life, his comrades launched a daring effort to rescue him. With a Russian sniper still watching the area, Ukrainian mortar teams deployed smoke rounds to cloak the position, providing just enough cover to carry out the evacuation.

""I spent three days in a coma (in a makeshift hospital in Azovstal),"" Dubyna, 38, says. ""I experienced a complete loss of memory. I didn't remember who I was or where I was.""

Though he survived and gradually regained his memory, returning to serve as a press officer for Azov — a symbol of Ukraine's resistance through its tenacious defense of Mariupol in the first three months of the full-scale war — the nightmare was far from over.

On May 16, 2022, Azovstal defenders were ordered to surrender to the encircling Russian forces. Exactly three years ago, on May 20, 2022, the surrender concluded. Dubyna, along with hundreds of other soldiers, was sent into Russian captivity, where he spent two and a half years.

Though 485 Azov Brigade members have been released from captivity since 2022, around 850 remain in Russian prisons three years later. The full extent of what happened in Azovstal and Mariupol may only come to light when every defender is free to share their story.

Still, the way Ukrainian soldiers defended the plant, despite injuries, exhaustion, and severe shortages of ammunition and even food, has already gone down in history as one of the most heroic military operations to date.

The last battle

Dubyna, who goes by the callsign ""Nikopol,"" after his hometown, joined Azov as a press officer in 2016. He left military service around 2020 to return to journalism, hoping to settle down and build a family.

But just two years later, instead of the calm life he'd hoped to build, Dubyna found himself back in uniform and straight into hell: Mariupol, at the center of the war's most brutal early battles.

""We understood that this would be a siege, and that we'd face a large concentration of enemy forces. But we also knew that the longer we held Mariupol, the more enemy forces would be tied down there, and those in surrounding cities (like Zaporizhzhia) would have time to prepare (for further assaults),"" Dubyna recalls.

As Russian troops advanced on Mariupol, Ukrainian defenders were pushed further back, with Azovstal — a vast steel plant featuring extensive underground tunnels — ultimately serving as their final bastion.

""I had lost a lot of blood, but there was no way to give me a transfusion or fluids, so my body had to recover on its own.""

Inside the plant, Ukrainian forces held their ground despite being cut off from supplies and surrounded by civilians, as Russian attacks leveled Mariupol around them.

To show the world the scale of Russia's assault, Azov's press service operated under life-threatening conditions, gathering footage and information from various positions across the city and later from inside the steel plant itself, Dubyna recalls.

""I spent about a month working in the press unit before being reassigned to one of the positions at Azovstal. It was supposed to be an observation post, but by then, there weren't enough people, too many were wounded or killed, so they had to pull officers from headquarters,"" Dubyna says.

""Our task was to monitor enemy movements and, if necessary, take up positions and hold the line,"" he adds. ""And during one of these actions, I was wounded.""

Dubyna says doctors were surprised he survived such a severe injury. He explained that the bullet passed through his neck, detaching arteries and veins from the muscles without rupturing the arteries themselves, which prevented rapid blood loss.

""At that point, (medics) didn't even have the means to transfuse blood to those who had lost it or provide any significant medical support,"" he recalls. ""I had lost a lot of blood, but there was no way to give me a transfusion or fluids, so my body had to recover on its own.""

About 10 days after his injury, Dubyna returned to his duties as a press officer.

""I even started writing some texts; it was tough to form sentences and string words together, but I tried to help however I could,"" he says.

As the battle escalated and Russian troops advanced deeper into the Azovstal plant, the defenders were ordered to surrender to save their lives.

""Under the conditions we were held in, many people lost their lives due to severe beatings and illnesses in captivity.""

""When Redis (Colonel Denys Prokopenko, Azov commander) gathered us and told us there was an order from the commander-in-chief to preserve lives, we accepted it calmly because we understood it was a direct order, and we had to carry it out,"" Dubyna says.

""But before that, no one saw surrender as an option. Everyone was prepared for the last battle,"" he says, adding that some soldiers even asked their comrades to kill them if they were severely wounded, just to avoid capture.

Dubyna says he was skeptical from the start about Russia's promise to release them after just a few months in captivity.

""Knowing the kind of enemy we were facing… I never believed it would be a quick release,"" he says.

""Unfortunately, under the conditions we were held in, many people lost their lives due to severe beatings and illnesses in captivity.""

It was, essentially, a ticket from one hell to another.

Routine torture

The evacuation from Azovstal ended on May 20, 2022, with Ukrainian soldiers transferred to a penal colony in Russian-occupied Olenivka, Donetsk Oblast, now infamous as the site of the mass killing of Azov fighters.

On July 28, an explosion killed 54 Ukrainian prisoners of war and injured over 150 at the Olenivka penal colony. Dubyna, who witnessed the event, says he is certain Russian forces were responsible, despite their attempts to blame Ukraine for the attack.

He says that a day before the attack, Russian guards gathered about 200 Azov fighters in one of the barracks.

""At first, we thought this was the start of a prisoner exchange,"" Dubyna recalls.

""They would threaten to cut off ears or a nose, pressing a knife to the ear and starting to cut it slightly, causing bleeding, all meant to terrify and break the prisoners.""

Then, at night, a powerful blast occurred. Dubyna says the prison's authorities prevented any assistance from reaching the injured.

""Only those inside that barrack tried to help each other with whatever they had, which was nothing. They tore their clothes to make bandages and did their best to save one another, pulling people out of the burning building.""

Those Ukrainian POWs who survived the blast in Olenivka were later transferred to the detention center in Russia's Taganrog, infamous for the use of torture against prisoners. It started as soon as the POWs arrived there.

""They just started throwing us onto the floor from trucks like we were sacks,"" Dubyna says.

""And right away, as soon as you hit the floor, they started beating you, kicking, hitting with batons, using stun guns.""

""It went on for several hours, while they were taking us through what they called 'intake.'""

He spent nine months there before being transferred to another facility in the city of Kamyshin, in Volgograd Oblast, enduring repeated interrogations accompanied by beatings and threats of death or rape, with almost no nutritious food or medical care provided.

""They would threaten to cut off ears or a nose, pressing a knife to the ear and starting to cut it slightly, causing bleeding, all meant to terrify and break the prisoners.""

According to the United Nations, more than 95% of Ukrainian POWs have been subjected to torture in Russian captivity.

Electric shock torture was routine in Kamyshin, he says.

""When they used it, it felt like all your bones were breaking, like your muscles were torn apart. The pain was so intense, you'd end up smashing your head against the floor just to make it more bearable,"" Dubyna says.

""They'd lay you down, hook the electrodes, and run electricity through you. It's the kind of experience you never forget.""

According to the United Nations, more than 95% of Ukrainian POWs have been subjected to torture in Russian captivity. Former detainees recount being brutally beaten, electrocuted, suffocated, and threatened with executions. Many come back with serious injuries, fractures, lost teeth, and signs of post-traumatic stress disorder.

With no connection to the outside world, Dubyna endured the horrors of Russian captivity by holding on to thoughts about his family and his girlfriend, Olha, whom he had dreamed of marrying.

L: Artem Dubyna with his partner at the Free Azov rally in an undated photo. (Artem Dubyna's personal archive) R: Artem Dubyna receives a Medal For Military Service to Ukraine in an undated photo. (Artem Dubyna's personal archive)

The long-awaited dream came true a month after Dubyna was released from captivity in September 2024.

""When you realize that you are back on free land, you're home… it was an indescribable feeling,"" he says.

""It's joy. It's the feeling of freedom, of lightness. You suddenly realize you no longer have to walk hunched over, that you can stand tall again, that you can look someone in the eyes when you speak, something that was unthinkable in captivity.""

After returning to Ukraine, POWs receive medical care and are entitled to a leave – its duration depends on the state of their health – before returning to service. As Dubyna’s leave is almost over, he is getting ready to rejoin his Azov Brigade in its ongoing fight against Russian aggression and to help bring back Azovstal defenders from captivity.

""I'm returning to service, back to Azov, to continue fighting for the return of our comrades.""

Editor's note: This article has been updated to reflect additional comments from Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha.

Ukraine will receive 400,000 additional artillery shells in 2025 through the Czech-led munitions initiative, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on May 20 on Telegram.

The initiative, supported by contributions from Canada, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, and other nations, has significantly enhanced Ukraine's artillery capabilities. Launched in 2024, it has become a vital supplement to the country's firepower amid shell shortages.

Following a meeting with Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala, Shmyhal said Ukraine received around 1.5 million artillery shells of various calibers through the initiative in 2024.

He announced that Czechia has increased its annual aid allocation to Ukraine to over $43 million. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Prague has provided $900 million in military assistance to Kyiv.

Fiala and Shmyhal also discussed expanding cooperation on weapons production, economic support, and humanitarian assistance.

""We will strengthen the integration of the Ukrainian and Czech defense industries,"" Shmyhal wrote. ""In addition, we agreed to cooperate in training Ukrainian pilots of F-16 airplanes.""

Czechia has played a leading role within the EU in rallying military support for Ukraine and has hosted hundreds of thousands of refugees since the start of the war.

The country's opposition party, ANO, has threatened to suspend the munitions initiative if it wins parliamentary elections in October 2025.

ANO deputy leader Karel Havlicek made the remarks in January, raising concerns about the future of one of Ukraine's most reliable arms pipelines.

In a separate initiative, the European Union has pledged to supply 2 million artillery rounds for Ukraine. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a post on social media on May 20 that EU countries ""have already committed two-thirds of 2 million artillery shells, and we are working to cover the remaining third as soon as possible.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/photo_2025-05-20_13-07-20-2.jpg

Russian law enforcement agencies have sent 20,000 naturalized migrants to fight in Ukraine for failing to register for military service, Investigative Committee Head Alexander Bastrykin said on May 20, according to state-owned TASS.

The revelation signals an intensifying crackdown on Russia's migrant population as the Kremlin struggles to meet front line manpower needs.

""Already 20,000 'young' citizens of Russia, who for some reason do not like living in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, are on the front lines,"" Bastrykin said during the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum.

He said he had ordered military investigators, police, and Russia's National Guard to conduct regular raids on areas where migrants live to catch those evading military registration.

Bastrykin earlier claimed many foreigners had begun ""slowly"" leaving Russia to avoid conscription and described the forced deployment of naturalized citizens as a ""trick"" to target migrants while fulfilling constitutional requirements.

The statement comes as Russian forces continue monthly recruitment drives of 30,000 to 40,000 people, according to Western intelligence cited by the Wall Street Journal.

With the memory of the unpopular 2022 partial mobilization still fresh — when more than 261,000 Russians fled the country — the Kremlin has avoided another mass draft.

Instead, it has turned to aggressive enlistment campaigns and financial incentives.

On March 31, Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized the spring conscription of 160,000 men — the country's largest call-up in 14 years.

Although conscripts are technically barred from front-line combat, rights groups and relatives have reported that many are pressured into signing contracts that result in deployment to Ukraine.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has proposed a free trade agreement between Ukraine and the U.S. to President Donald Trump, Deputy Economy Minister and Trade Representative Taras Kachka said on May 20.

According to Kachka, Zelensky offered an agreement in a letter to Trump, alongside mentioning other opportunities for cooperation in trade and the defence industry.

""This, accordingly, will be the next stage of our conversations,"" Kachka said during a conference in Ukraine’s capital.

Kyiv is interested in such an agreement, despite the fact that the U.S. is not Ukraine's largest trading partner, he added.

""We are interested in free trade agreements with all G7 countries. That is, we have (agreements) with Britain, Canada, and the European Union. We also need the United States and Japan,"" he said.

Ukraine and the U.S. launched initial talks on a free trade zone back in 2021.

Earlier, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that Kyiv seeks to boost bilateral trade and an agreement with the U.S. to allow ""everything except for the fixed exceptions.""

Moscow released the oil tanker Green Admire on May 19, a day after detaining the vessel in Russian territorial waters as it transited from Estonia, Estonian Public Broadcasting (ERR) reported.

The detention followed recent moves by Estonia and its neighbors to clamp down on Russia's so-called ""shadow fleet,"" which is used to bypass Western oil sanctions.

The Green Admire, a Liberian-flagged vessel owned by a Greek company, departed the Estonian port of Sillamae on May 18 carrying shale oil.

Its route — agreed upon in advance by Estonia, Russia, and Finland — crossed Russian territorial waters, where it was intercepted by Russian authorities.

Estonian officials said the ship had followed its planned navigation route but was seized after allegedly failing to respond to repeated Russian warnings upon entering a zone Moscow had unilaterally declared ""dangerous for navigation.""

Estonia's Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said the detention was likely tied to growing pressure on Russia's shadow fleet, which Western nations have accused of illegally transporting oil in defiance of international sanctions.

The incident occurred just days after Russia reportedly violated NATO airspace with a Su-35 fighter jet during Estonia's attempt to intercept a flagless tanker suspected of operating as part of the shadow fleet.

The Estonian Navy had previously detained such a vessel on April 11, marking the first enforcement action against Russia's covert maritime trade network in the region.

Baltic countries have voiced alarm over what they describe as increasing Russian military activity in the area.

Washington plans to spend about $250 million of foreign aid funds to repatriate people from active conflict zones, including about 200,000 Ukrainians and 500,000 Haitians, the Washington Post reported on May 20, citing the draft internal documents the newspaper obtained.

During Joe Biden's presidency, Ukrainians and Haitians were granted temporary protection, allowing them to stay in the U.S. if they could not return to their home country.

With the Trump administration coming to office, the U.S. has tightened its immigration policy. U.S. President Donald Trump previously pledged to impose harsher legislation on migrants and launch the ""largest deportation program in U.S. history,"" aimed at removing 15 to 20 million migrants from the country.

According to the draft internal documents, the proposal was prepared after the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement on May 5. The statement read that those immigrants who voluntarily leave the U.S. for their home countries would be eligible for $1,000 in assistance.

Besides Ukrainians and Haitians, the draft documents also mention Afghans, Palestinians, Libyans, Sudanese, Syrians, and Yemenis, who could become other targets of the deportation program, the WP reported.

Tricia McLaughlin, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, verified the documents' authenticity, but described them as ""outdated."" McLaughlin added that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has not made a ""final"" decision on temporary protected status for Haiti or Ukraine.

According to the draft documents reviewed by the newspaper, the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) will fund the voluntary resettlement program using funds allocated by Congress for charter flights or commercial airfare.

The State Department has acknowledged that it is working with the Department of Homeland Security to provide ""travel support and financial incentives"" to encourage migrants to leave the country voluntarily.

The Trump administration's proposal has been criticized, including by former government officials who called it inhumane and counter to long-held U.S. ideals, the WP reported.

According to the plan's opponents, the Trump administration is forcing asylum seekers to return to countries where they are ""at risk of being killed."" They also questioned whether the plan constitutes an abuse of foreign aid funds intended primarily to support refugees and their resettlement.

In late January, Washington suspended acceptance of applications from Ukrainians for asylum under the Uniting for Ukraine program. This program allowed for two years of asylum in the U.S., as well as the right to work, study, and have health insurance, among other benefits.

President Volodymyr Zelensky had to remind U.S. President Donald Trump that negotiations with Russia are already underway after Trump announced to EU leaders the Kremlin's readiness for talks, Axios reported on May 20, citing sources present at the call.

The exchange reportedly took place during a phone call involving Trump, Zelensky, and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy, Finland, and the European Commission. It followed Trump's earlier call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which the Russian leader provided vague assurances about peace efforts but again rejected a ceasefire in Ukraine.

Trump told the leaders that Putin agreed to start direct negotiations on a ceasefire immediately, which led to a few seconds of ""puzzled silence"" during the call, Axios' source said.

Zelensky then reminded Trump that Putin had previously agreed to this, and the first round of direct talks had already taken place on May 16 in Istanbul, marking the first direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow since 2022. Trump did not directly respond, the sources said.

The Ukrainian president and other leaders also pointed out to Trump that it had been his idea to start the peace talks with an immediate 30-day ceasefire, according to Axios.

Kyiv agreed to a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire on March 11, though Moscow has rejected it. Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose additional sanctions against Russia unless it accepts the deal, but has not taken the step.

Participants on the call reportedly seemed ""surprised"" that Trump was ""relatively content"" with what he heard from Putin. Even though the Kremlin's position has not changed, Trump presented this as a new development in the negotiation process.

When asked about potential sanctions against Russia, the U.S. president said he did not think it was a good idea, adding that he believes Putin wants a deal. Trump told the group that Putin would present a ""peace memo"" with his terms for a ceasefire and an end to the war.

Axios' source also said that Trump told Zelensky and the European leaders that he asked Putin to present ""something that people can agree to,"" not a proposal that would be immediately rejected.

Responding to Finnish President Alexander Stubb's question on his next steps, the U.S. president said that somebody ""has to come out and say whether the negotiations are going well or badly,"" and then the U.S. will decide what to do, Axios reported.

European leaders have urged the U.S. to impose additional sanctions on Russia to pressure it toward a ceasefire. Speaking to reporters after his call with Putin, Trump said he has no intention of taking the step so as not to disrupt peace efforts.

The U.S. president also declared he trusts Putin and reiterated his readiness to withdraw from the peace process unless progress is made.

POZNAN — For years, I have taken every opportunity to urge the European Union and its member states to invest more in defense.

When Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, I repeatedly asked (as a member of the European Parliament) what further proof we would need to recognize the threats facing all of Europe. What would we – as Europeans – do if our security was threatened while our closest ally, the United States, was otherwise engaged?

Today, we confront that very situation. U.S. officials are openly stating that they do not intend to devote most of their time or resources to dealing with what they deem European issues. According to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the U.S. has “other priorities to focus on.”

I agree. The global superpower has global responsibilities, and the number of flash points that might demand the U.S. government’s attention seems only to be growing. In addition to challenges in the Western hemisphere, instability in the Middle East, and severe tensions between two nuclear powers — India and Pakistan — there is also the paramount goal of redefining relations with China.

Moreover, according to the official U.S. Defense Department planning doctrine, the U.S. can no longer fight more than one major war at a time.

The new U.S. administration has been communicating its position plainly.

“We’re here today to directly and unambiguously express that stark strategic realities prevent the United States of America from being primarily focused on the security of Europe,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced in Brussels this February.

And U.S. Vice President JD Vance was even more direct, stating that “Europe’s entire security infrastructure … has been subsidized by the United States of America,” even though it is neither in Europe’s nor America’s interest “for Europe to be a permanent security vassal of the United States.”

President Donald Trump himself has repeatedly accused Europe of “freeloading” and “taking advantage” of the U.S.

Europeans may not like what we hear, but we cannot pretend not to hear it. We must be prepared for the U.S. to wash its hands not only of Ukraine, but even of Europe.

Le Monde’s Sylvie Kauffmann recently argued, “Preparing for the worst is a safer bet than hoping for the best.” We can and should do both — hope and prepare. Trust but verify.

Ever since Trump announced his presidential candidacy back in 2015, there have been two schools of thought on interpreting his words. Some argue that we should take him seriously but not literally, whereas others urge us to do the opposite: treat him literally but not always seriously. I believe that the most reasonable and respectable approach is to treat whatever the U.S. president says both literally and seriously.

Given the current state of the world, this implies that Europe faces an existential choice. We can enter the global game united, as a heavyweight competitor, or we can condemn ourselves to marginalization.

Much has been done already to become a heavyweight contender. Since 2016 — just before Trump’s first term — NATO members, excluding the U.S., have increased their annual defense spending by 98%, from $255 billion to $506 billion.

Moreover, after three years of Putin waging all-out war on Ukraine, the EU and its member states have proven willing to spend even more and to embrace a more cooperative, rational, and effective approach to defense planning and procurement. The new joint defense agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom is another step demonstrating this new strategic solidarity.

Deterring Russia is not beyond our means. We don’t need to match U.S. military capabilities; rather, we just need enough to force Putin to reconsider his chances of winning in a confrontation with a united European community of democratic nation-states.

The people of Europe are clearly demanding that we develop a revitalized European defense posture. According to the European Commission, 71% of EU citizens believe that the bloc must strengthen its ability to produce military equipment, while 77% support a common defense and security policy. This gives European leaders a mandate to think and act boldly.

But how long will it take to restore peace to Ukraine and stability to Europe? I believe we must act on the basis of three assumptions. First, we should view this as a war of a former imperial metropole against what it regards as a mutinous colony. History suggests that colonial wars usually take about a decade to end. Anything less than that should be considered a bonus.

Second, we should accept that for the invading country to start negotiating in good faith, it must conclude that the invasion was a mistake. It must acknowledge that the costs of war, and of keeping the former colony subjugated, are greater than whatever benefits the colony can possibly yield. Third, given the above, we should remember that colonial wars are usually finished by a different group of leaders than those who started the fighting.

Yes, boosting European defense capabilities while supporting Ukraine will cost money. Since the start of Russia’s war of aggression, the EU and its member states have provided more than $165 billion in support for Ukraine and its people. That is a significant amount, but it is still less than 1% of the combined GDP of the EU’s member countries (some $19 trillion). We can certainly do more.

And as we reinvigorate Europe’s defenses, we must not lose sight of why we are doing it: we are acting for our own safety, not to undermine transatlantic relations but to improve them. To avoid a strategic dilemma, we Europeans must be able to help the U.S. defend its allies by taking on our fair share of the security burden.

Russia is trying to buy time to continue the war in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on May 20, reacting to a recent call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Zelensky's statement follows his call with Finnish President Alexander Stubb, during which the Ukrainian leader told his counterpart about his May 19 phone call with Trump, as well as the latter's talks with Putin.

""It is obvious that Russia is trying to buy time to continue the war and occupation,"" Zelensky said on X. ""We are working with our partners to pressure the Russians to change their behavior.""

Zelensky thanked the partners who continue to impose sanctions on Russia for its aggression in Ukraine and stressed that the war should end at the negotiating table.

""Clear and realistic proposals must be on the table. Ukraine is ready for any effective negotiation format. And if Russia continues to put forward unrealistic conditions and undermine possible results, there must be harsh consequences,"" Zelensky said.

Zelensky's remarks coincide with new sanctions unveiled by the EU and the U.K. on May 20, targeting shadow fleet vessels, entities helping Russia avoid sanctions, actors involved in Russia's military sector, information and hybrid operations, and more.

The British government announced 100 new sanctions against Russia on May 20, pledging to ramp up pressure as Moscow continues to reject a ceasefire in Ukraine.

The new measures, announced in coordination with the EU's 17th sanctions package, target ""entities supporting Russia's military machine, energy exports and information war, as well as financial institutions"" supporting the Russian war effort.

Even as London and Brussels unveil new economic measures, U.S. President Donald Trump said Washington does not plan to impose additional sanctions to avoid disrupting peace efforts.

The U.K. stressed that the sanctions follow the largest Russian drone strike against Ukraine, involving 273 drones launched against the country overnight on May 18. The restrictions aim to disrupt Russia's supply of weaponry, namely Iskander missiles, which are often used in strikes against civilians.

The sanctions further target 14 more members of the Kremlin-funded Social Design Agency (SDA), a sanctioned Russian company accused of information operations aimed at undermining democracy and the rule of law in Ukraine and abroad.

The package also includes 18 shadow fleet vessels, 46 financial institutions helping Russia evade sanctions, and measures to prevent Russia from reconnecting to the global economy. The U.K. further said it is reviewing the possibility of further lowering the $60-per-barrel price cap imposed on Russian crude oil.

""(Russian President Vladimir) Putin’s latest strikes once again show his true colours as a warmonger,"" U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in a statement.

""We have been clear that delaying peace efforts will only redouble our resolve to help Ukraine to defend itself and use our sanctions to restrict Putin’s war machine.""

European leaders have threatened Russia with additional sanctions unless Putin commits to a ceasefire and agrees to seriously engage in peace efforts. President Volodymyr Zelensky also announced that a new ""strong EU sanctions package"" is underway.

The status quo in Russia-Ukraine peace efforts has not changed after a call between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said on May 20 on X.

Putin and Trump held a phone call on May 19, during which the Russian leader refused to agree to a ceasefire and instead declared readiness to negotiate a ""memorandum regarding a potential future peace treaty.""

""Unfortunately, following the Trump-Putin phone call, the status quo has not changed,"" Podolyak wrote on X, adding that Ukraine continues to offer an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, while Europe fully supports this step.

Podolyak noted that the United States remains a global mediator, believing that Russia will negotiate for business and strategic interests. At the same time, Russia's position remains unchanged in its willingness to continue the war, he added.

""There is Russia's unchanged position: it still seeks war, destruction, and killing, believing them to be the only means of preserving its current state. There is a Russia that is unwilling — and categorically refuses — to accept a ceasefire,"" Podolyak said.

""And there is also this obsessive search for the so-called 'root causes of the war,' even though the only real cause is the simple fact of Russia’s unprovoked aggression.""

After speaking with Trump, Putin said Russia's position in the negotiations remains unchanged and requires ""eliminating the root causes"" of the war.

The call also follows largely inconclusive Russian-Ukrainian negotiations in Istanbul on May 16, where Russia sent a delegation of low-level officials and reiterated sweeping territorial demands, including that Ukraine accept the loss of Crimea and four eastern regions.

The EU has formally approved its 17th package of sanctions imposed on Russia over aggression in Ukraine, including measures against almost 200 shadow fleet vessels, top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas announced on May 20.

""New measures also address hybrid threats and human rights. More sanctions on Russia are in the works,"" Kallas said on X.

The step comes as the U.S. signals disinterest in imposing additional sanctions against Russia, even as Moscow refuses Western-backed ceasefire proposals.

The 17th package was supported by EU ambassadors last week, but has since then been criticized as weak and watered down.

The new sanctions target members of Russia’s military and political elite and foreign entities in China or the United Arab Emirates, accused of helping the Kremlin evade already-imposed measures.

The EU will also sanction more than 20 entities and individuals disseminating disinformation, and 20 judges and prosecutors involved in legal cases against Russian opposition, specifically Vladimir Kara-Murza and late Alexei Navalny.

The package also targets components vital to Russia’s defense industry, namely chemicals, materials, and dual-use goods.

The Hungarian parliament on May 20 supported a bill on launching Hungary's withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC).

The government-proposed bill, supported by 134 lawmakers, would see Hungary exit the international body that it co-founded in 2002. The Hague-based court is tasked with prosecuting international crimes of genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity.

The vote formalizes Hungary's intention, which was first announced in early April during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Budapest. The Hungarian government has sharply criticized the ICC's decision to issue an arrest warrant for the Israeli leader over alleged war crimes in Gaza.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has said that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will soon be notified of the decision. The withdrawal will be formalized one year after the secretary-general receives the written notification.

While the bill on the withdrawal was approved only on May 20, Szijjarto said already back in late April that the Hungarian legislature had backed the move to exit the ICC.

""With this decision, we refuse to be part of a politicized institution that has lost its impartiality and credibility,"" Szijjarto wrote at the time.

In March 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the forcible deportation of children from Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine.

President Volodymyr Zelensky on May 19 rejected Vladimir Putin's demand to withdraw Ukrainian troops from four partially occupied regions, after the Russian president held a call with U.S. President Donald Trump and once again failed to agree to a full ceasefire.

""It's our land, we won't withdraw our troops from our territory... it means that they don't want peace… if they demand what they know we won't agree to,"" Zelensky said at a press briefing attended by the Kyiv Independent.

The comments come after Putin held a phone call with Trump, during which he continued to refuse to agree to a full ceasefire, stating he is prepared to negotiate a ""memorandum regarding a potential future peace treaty.""

Russia's maximalist position in the negotiations remains unchanged and requires ""eliminating the root causes"" of the war, Putin added.

After the conversation, Trump said on Truth Social that Russia and Ukraine will ""immediately start"" negotiations toward a ceasefire and an end to the war.

Trump took office 118 days ago promising to end the war in Ukraine within 100 days.

""The conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of,"" Trump added.

Putin's foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, told Russian journalists that the presidents spoke for two hours and five minutes, and a ceasefire deadline was not mentioned.

""For Trump, the most important thing is direct talks between Ukraine and Russia,"" Zelensky said, adding that Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and Russian President Vladimir Putin's adviser, Vladimir Medinsky, held a call on May 19 and discussed a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange.

The exchange will happen ""in the next days or weeks,"" and civilians will not be included in the list, according to Zelensky.

A source in the President's Office told the Kyiv Independent that Trump and Zelensky spoke twice on May 19 — once before the scheduled call with Putin and again after it.

According to Zelensky, during his phone call with the U.S. president, he advocated for a ceasefire, the opportunity to express views on the memorandum, and for decisions regarding Ukraine not to be made without Ukraine's involvement.

Zelensky also said there would be a ""strong EU sanctions package,"" though he didn't say when it would be imposed. He added Ukraine was expecting ""when they see fit, the U.S. to impose sanctions on Russian banks and energy sector.""

""This would be an important, strong mechanism,"" he added.

The calls follow days of largely inconclusive negotiations in Istanbul, where Russia sent a delegation of low-level officials and reiterated sweeping territorial demands, including that Ukraine accept the loss of Crimea and four eastern regions.

The second conversation between Zelensky and Trump lasted for over an hour and included Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, French President Emmanuel Macron, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and European Council President Antonio Costa.

Zelensky also said that Kyiv is exploring the possibility of a meeting with delegations from Ukraine, Russia, the US, and the EU in Turkey, the Vatican, or Switzerland.

Trump on also claimed on May 19 that Russia is interested in engaging in large-scale trade with the United States once the war ends.

""There is a tremendous opportunity for Russia to create massive amounts of jobs and wealth. Its potential is unlimited. Likewise, Ukraine can be a great beneficiary on trade, in the process of rebuilding its country,"" he said.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov described the phone call between the two presidents as ""productive"" and highlighted Trump's ""neutral"" stance on the war.

Speaking to reporters, Peskov said, ""Trump's position is neutral and he does deal with settlement issues, while the position of European politicians is openly pro-Ukrainian.""

The U.S. president's approach to negotiations frustrates European allies, many of whom sought his support for a joint U.S.–EU ultimatum demanding an unconditional ceasefire starting May 12 and tougher sanctions on Moscow.

The European Union will adopt the 17th package of sanctions against Russia on May 20, while the next package of restrictions is ""already in motion,"" Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said on May 19 on X.

EU ambassadors on May 14 agreed on the bloc's 17th package of sanctions against Russia, primarily targeting its shadow fleet of oil tankers. Following the news, President Volodymyr Zelensky also announced that an important ""strong EU sanctions package"" is underway.

""Putin hasn't changed his goals — he still wants to destroy Ukraine and rewrite Europe's borders. He has rejected ceasefire proposals and continues heavy attacks on Ukraine,"" Tsahkna wrote on X.

Ground Forces Commander Mykhailo Drapatyi ordered an inspection of the scandal-hit Ukrainian 155th ""Anne of Kyiv"" Brigade following misconduct allegations within the brigade's command, Ukrainska Pravda reported on May 19.

Drapatyi said this in a written statement to Ukrainska Pravda after the outlet published an investigation into a possible involvement of the brigade's commander, Colonel Taras Maksimov, in handing out falsified bonus payments and demanding bribes.

The investigation also noted over 1,200 cases of personnel going absent without official leave (AWOL) since 2025 and failure to sufficiently supply the unit.

The Western-trained brigade had previously faced a scandal in 2024, where a media investigation uncovered rampant mismanagement and desertion among the personnel, leading to an inspection and a command change.

In early May, a new controversy arose after law enforcement officers detained the acting commander of the unmanned systems battalion of the 155th Brigade, Lieutenant Colonel Sviatoslav Shumsky.

According to investigators, the officer demanded bribes from his subordinates to grant them falsified bonuses for allegedly participating in combat on the front line.

Ukrainska Pravda's sources in the brigade said that Shumsky was merely an intermediary between service members and the command, and that similar schemes likely operate in other battalions.

Maksimov's possible involvement in the scheme is under investigation, the outlet said, citing law enforcement sources.

In response to Ukrainska Pravda's inquiry, Drapatyi emphasized that he devoted much time to setting up the 155th Separate Mechanized Brigade, finding a capable command, building up its combat capability, and providing it with drones.

The commander added that Maksimov's candidacy for the 155th Brigade commander position was also selected by Volodymyr Shvediuk, the chief of the Western Operational Command.

Drapatyi said that when looking for a candidate, he considered personal experience, feedback from his comrades, and the results of Maksimov's previous service. Drapatyi added that other candidates were also considered, but some had a lower professional level, and some refused because of other offers.

The commander mentioned that the brigade was uncoordinated and poorly prepared at the time of the change of command. In Drapatyi's opinion, Maksimov's appointment significantly improved the brigade's condition and combat capability.

""Whatever the achievements, I will not cover for anyone — there are no untouchables for me. I'm waiting for the results of all the inspections and what the investigation will find,"" Drapatyi said, adding that the investigation by the State Bureau of Investigation (DBR) is still ongoing.

""The command... is fully committed to exposing all those involved in the extortion. I want to emphasize to everyone who organizes such schemes: robbing their own brigade, mocking their comrades, profiting from blood. The punishment will be severe,"" he added.

The brigade, initially intended as a flagship project for Ukrainian military modernization, was trained and equipped with assistance from France and other foreign partners.

The brigade, which has approximately 5,800 troops, faced challenges from its inception. According to an investigation by Yurii Butusov, editor-in-chief of Censor.net, 2,500 service members were reassigned to other units before training began, depleting its experienced personnel.

Between March and November 2024, over 1,700 soldiers reportedly abandoned their posts, with an additional 50 deserting while training in France.

Of the 1,924 soldiers sent to France for training, only 51 had more than a year of military service, while 1,414 had served fewer than two months. Replenishment efforts brought in new recruits, but Butusov claimed proper selection processes were often neglected, exacerbating the unit's operational challenges.

The media investigation prompted a high-level inquiry and led to the dismissal and detention of its then-commander, Colonel Dmytro Riumshyn. Maksimov was appointed to take his place.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/q132bb595v3e1.jpeg

Editor’s Note: In accordance with the security protocols of the Ukrainian military, soldiers featured in this story are identified by first names and callsigns only.

Every year, as the way war is fought constantly evolves on the battlefields of Ukraine, the visuals of the fighting on the ground that constantly flood the internet transform with it.

In the frantic first weeks of the full-scale invasion, it was Russian tanks stolen by farmers tossing their turrets after Ukrainian Javelin strikes. Over the Battle of Bakhmut, we got used to images of brutal World War I-style trench warfare in the 21st century.

2024 was undoubtedly the year of the first-person-view (FPV) drones, with their characteristic screech through the air and messy static picture often capturing the last moments of a soldier’s life.

In 2025, something new has arrived. Images of kilometers-long tunnels of netting erected over entire roads, of city streets and fields covered in a dense tangle of glistening thread, and of the same FPV drone strike footage, but now with perfect camera quality.

This year’s new arrivals on the visual fabric of the battlefield have one thing in common: they are all connected with the weapon shaping entire operations: the fiber optic FPV drone.

In a war defined by constant innovation, this deceptively simple tweak to standard FPV drones makes them immune to electronic warfare (EW) and free of limitations brought by radio horizon.

The drones have already made a serious impact — from their role in Russia’s recapture of Kursk Oblast to the devastation of logistics all across the front line.

What’s more: unlike many of the full-scale war’s most effective innovations, fiber optic drones were first introduced not by pioneering Ukrainian drone teams, but by Russian forces.

What is a fiber optic drone?

At its core, a fiber optic drone of the kind used in Ukraine is simply a modification of the standard FPV drone that has already once transformed the way war is fought.

Usually, this means a quadcopter design on a carbon fiber, aluminum, or polymer frame, upon which electronics are welded on in the middle, a battery is strapped to the top, and — right before flying out on a combat mission — the munition is strapped to the bottom.

The difference is in the communication between the drone and its pilot.

Most FPV drones receive their control inputs and beam back video through standard analog or digital antennas, meaning that maintaining a decent signal connection, even at great distances, is crucial for reaching and engaging targets.

To achieve this, vertical antennas on the drone position are often complemented by signal booster drones, allowing the FPV to fly further, although still limited by the radio horizon of the terrain.

Then there is jamming: EW devices of all shapes and sizes, from smaller systems mounted on vehicles to protect them from FPVs, to larger, more powerful units that can deny a whole area at a distance.

When flying on fiber optic, the drone pilot is not concerned by questions of radio horizon or electronic warfare, and — so long as the fiber itself isn’t damaged or broken mid-flight — can count on a perfect video feed right up to the target.

Often, FPV drones on both sides are jammed by friendly as well as enemy EW, as many different teams from different units work out of the same sector without coordinating who is switching on their EW when.

Fiber optic drones remove all of these problems from the equation, and for that reason, have been game-changing.

Hanging under the drone, usually between the frame and the munition, a large but fairly lightweight cylinder holds a long spool of lightweight optical fiber which gradually releases as the drone flies forward.

Essentially, this makes the drone a wire-guided precision weapon, like the Cold-War era TOW anti-tank missiles developed by the United States.

When flying on fiber optic, the drone pilot is not concerned by questions of radio horizon or electronic warfare, and — so long as the fiber itself isn’t damaged or broken mid-flight — can count on a perfect video feed right up to the target.

Over 2024 especially, both Ukraine and Russia invested heavily in expensive EW systems to protect vehicles and other high-value targets, but against these new drones, they are rendered useless. Likewise, the same goes for radio-based drone detector devices commonly used by units to warn them of FPVs flying in the area.

As has been demonstrated by both sides on the battlefield, fiber optic also allows FPV drones to fly where they never could before.

“They're really great when you need to fly into some kind of building, like a large shed or hangar, to have a look inside if there is something there with the ability to strike it straight away,” said Oleksandr “Skhid,” an FPV drone team commander in Ukraine’s Achilles Strike Drone Regiment. “The same goes for other types of cover, and flying in forested areas.”

The drone design is not without its downsides. The weight and bulk of the fiber optic spool means that a larger drone frame with more powerful motors and a larger battery is needed, creating a final airframe that is slower, less maneuverable, and easier to shoot down with small arms than standard FPV drones.

The hard connection between pilot and drone also leaves a physical trail of fiber after every flight, which, once they start to accumulate, can become visible.

“The fiber is very reflective in the sunlight, and it makes it possible to find the place where you fly out of,” said Skhid. “That's why it's better to switch positions more often.”

Russian origins

In the cat-and-mouse technological game of the full-scale war, it is often Ukraine that has held the reputation of being better innovators, with more motivated engineers and volunteers allowed to work in a more flexible environment.

Often, if a new Ukrainian product or solution proves to be effective on the battlefield — like the early use of the basic FPV drone — Russia tends to copy it and ramp up production.

But with fiber optic drones, Russia was first, and the story of how it happened challenges perceptions of Russia’s war machine as being a lumbering, inert organization.

“Beginning with 2023, many key Russian military commentators, bloggers and military personalities were calling for the Russians not just to match Ukrainian (drone) capabilities step for step, but to essentially achieve a breakthrough,” said military analyst Samuel Bendett, who has closely followed the efforts of grassroots Russian innovators and volunteer efforts over the full-scale war.

At the time, both sides were increasingly looking to artificial intelligence as a solution to the jamming problem, with both solutions like AI-powered target recognition and pixel-locking that allow a drone to fly the last leg of its journey to the target.

Ultimately though, with autonomous targeting often less reliable than a capable pilot and needing more expensive hardware on the drone itself, Russian drone engineers looked to think outside the box, arriving at the idea of the fiber optic drone.

The first fiber optic drone model deployed at scale to the front line was the Knyaz Vandal Novgorodsky, a product of the Ushkuinik military technology accelerator project founded by Russian political scientist-turned volunteer Aleksey Chadaev.

First deployed in Kursk Oblast in August 2024 and scaled up as attempts to expel the Ukrainian presence inside Russian territory accelerated, the drone quickly proved to be extremely effective, particularly at targeting already strained Ukrainian logistics routes across the state border.

By late winter, when Russian assaults on the Kursk salient intensified, soldiers reported that fiber optic drones played a crucial role in making the Ukrainian presence in the salient untenable.

""Our logistics just collapsed; fiber optic drones were monitoring all routes, leaving no way to deliver ammunition or provisions,” said Dmytro, a Ukrainian medic fighting out of the Russian town of Sudzha at the time, to the Kyiv Independent.



“Traveling there was even worse than playing Russian roulette — because in this case, the revolver has five bullets and only one empty chamber.""

Now, top Russian drone units, including Rubicon and Sudny Den (“Judgement Day”), with their extensive experience of using fiber optic drones in Kursk Oblast, have transferred to Donetsk Oblast, according to the units’ Telegram channels.

There, they have quickly begun to boost Russian offensive efforts in the area, especially around the front-line hotspots of Pokrovsk and Toretsk.

Speaking to the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity, Ukrainian soldiers from two different brigades fighting near Toretsk reported a sharp increase in vehicle casualty rates after more fiber optic drones started flying in the area, with one saying that the whole brigade had run out of medical evacuation vehicles in the space of a month.

With the technology continuing to be refined, and longer spools being fitted to larger drones on both sides, important logistical hubs could come under threat, even without the front line itself getting much closer.



In April, Russian fiber optic drones began to fly into the city of Kostiantynivka, a central logistical node north of Toretsk and just over 10 kilometers from the contact line, with videos posted of both military and civilian vehicles hit.

Playing catch-up

In a nondescript village house in Donetsk Oblast, a young military engineer with the call-sign “Barbara” screws propellers onto a quadcopter drone.

On his desk, alongside the typical markers of drone-making equipment — 3D printers, soldering irons, wires, and zip-ties — are a row of large fiber optic spools.

This humble workshop is where the legendary Azov Brigade of Ukraine’s National Guard, recently promoted to corps level, prepares its new fiber optic drones.

Seeing the importance of the technology, Azov, along with many of Ukraine’s more specialized drone units, has been quicker out of the gate to experiment with and adopt fiber optic drones.

Like with any other drone technology, the unit works in tight cooperation with Ukrainian manufacturers, tightening the feedback loop from factory to front line.

“These types of drones have proven themselves in combat, they've proven their effectiveness, and the Russians are basically saying that this is something they should invest in.”

With Ukraine’s FPV drone production already well-developed at scale, the ability to pivot to more production of fiber optic simply requires a stable access to quality cable, most of which comes from China.

In Ukraine, ready-made fiber optic spools are available for purchase on online marketplace AliExpress, though, as with all drone parts, manufacturers are looking to move away from dependence on China due to the country’s warm relations with the Kremlin.

""Previously, it was mostly just Chinese spools,” he said. “Now, our manufacturers have started to take action and quite successfully. Perhaps, they lost a bit of time, but now all capacities are being ramped up.""

In late February, Ukraine’s Unmanned Systems Forces unveiled the Silkworm, a domestically-made fiber modular optic spool that can be used both on FPV drones and unmanned ground vehicles, which also often suffer from comms difficulties on the battlefield.

As Ukrainian production gets into gear, the rapid training of pilots and the establishment of best practices are their own challenges.

Receiving their first fiber optic drones toward the end of the winter, Skhid’s team has continued to fly mostly on standard FPV drones, turning to fiber optic only when absolutely necessary.

“We haven't completely figured out fiber optic yet,” said Skhid. “We have several different manufacturers, we are testing them continuously, we don't have a simple workflow.”

""Right now, I wouldn't say that quantity is the most important thing,” added Barbara. “We need quality, and it’s more important that everyone who deals with fiber optic understands what to do with it and how to handle it.""

Transforming the war

So far, the successful use of fiber optic among Ukrainian forces is limited to the top tier of well-equipped, professional drone units, like the Achilles regiment or Azov's native drone battalion.

“This (2025) will be the year of fiber optic,” said Kyrylo Veres, a prominent Ukrainian officer and commander of K-2, another one of the military’s top drone regiments, in an interview with Ukrainian media in March.

“But at the moment, it’s being used effectively by about one in 10 Ukrainian drone units. When we reach a point where nine out of 10 are using it, and the rest are quickly catching up, then we will see some serious results.”

In the meantime, Russia’s current advantage in the use of fiber optic — right as offensive efforts are gaining momentum across the front line with the approach of summer — is proving to be a serious challenge for the Ukrainian defense.

“It was a raw, unproven technology, but it has since expanded and everyone now recognizes this advantage,” said Bendett.

“These types of drones have proven themselves in combat, they've proven their effectiveness, and the Russians are basically saying that this is something they should invest in.”

Countermeasures to fiber optic drones are so far limited to physical shooting down, entanglement, or obstruction.

Along key logistics routes in the deadliest zone of the front line, both sides have been seen setting up long tunnels of lightweight netting for protection from the aerial threat, although videos have also emerged of Russian fiber optic drones simply flying underneath the nets to hit Ukrainian vehicles.

As fiber optic drones are fitted with larger and larger spools, they consistently fly further than most standard FPVs.

The long-term consequences for front-line logistics look to be transformative to the way war is fought, in the same way that drones first made the immediate zero line much deadlier than at the outset of the full-scale invasion.

“At the moment, most of our spools are 10 kilometers long, a few are 15 kilometeкs long, and the 20-kilometer spools are still being tested,” said Skhid.



“I can't wait to try some of the longer-range spools, it will really increase our ability to find all kinds of Russian equipment in buildings further in the rear.”

North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un could be investigated by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for supporting Russia's war against Ukraine, Song Sang-hyun, former president of the ICC, said on May 19, Yonhap reported.

""There is an opportunity for Ukrainian authorities, as the victim, to file a complaint against North Korea with the ICC,"" Song said. ""While a complaint filed by Ukraine would be ideal, the ICC also has the authority to initiate an independent investigation.""

Song's statement comes as North Korea confirmed in late April for the first time that it had sent troops to fight against Ukraine alongside Russian forces in Kursk Oblast.

Despite numerous human rights violations in North Korea, the ICC has not indicted Kim. However, as of now, there are sufficient legal grounds for Ukraine to initiate a case against him for assisting Russia in waging the war, according to the former ICC chief.

""The time is right to bring Kim Jong Un before the ICC,"" Song said at an international conference in Seoul, adding that North Korean military assistance to Russia is grounds for filing a complaint against Pyongyang.

Song also urged the ICC to respond more actively to war crimes committed by the North Korean leadership and their allies.

North Korea first dispatched around 11,000 troops to aid Russia in the fall of 2024. An additional 3,000 troops were reportedly sent earlier this year after Kyiv reported that more than a third of North Korean soldiers have been killed or injured in combat.

Nearly 56,000 residents have been evacuated from Sumy Oblast as efforts are ongoing to relocate more residents under mandatory evacuation orders, Oleh Hryhorov, the governor of Sumy Oblast said on May 19.

Sumy Oblast, located on Ukraine's northeast border with Russia, is subject to daily attacks, and is situated just across from Russia's Kursk Oblast - the region subject to Ukraine's ongoing incursion.

In recent months, Russian troops have significantly increased the use of guided aerial bombs as well as attack drones near the border areas of Sumy Oblast. Most recently, Russia has been deploying small assault groups to infiltrate the region in a bid to expand the front line.

Currently, over 86,000 residents are subject to mandatory evacuation orders in the region, with approximately 65% of the population having already evacuated, Hryhorov told Suspilne Sumy. A total of 2,400 residents were evacuated in the last week, the governor added.

The evacuations continue after local authorities in September 2024 ordered mandatory evacuation of children accompanied by their parents from an expanded area within the 10-kilometer zone bordering Russia.

All residents within the 10-kilometer zone bordering Russia have already been evacuated entirely, the military administration noted.

The additional evacuations come following a Russian attack on a civilian bus in Bilopillia, Sumy Oblast in the early morning of May 17, which killed nine people and injuring seven more.

Hryhorov said that a total of 13 residents were killed last week in Russian attacks on the region.

While Ukraine presses for an unconditional ceasefire, in line with proposals from the U.S., Russia continues to reject the terms.

On May 19, U.S. President Donald Trump held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin in which Putin expressed readiness to prepare to negotiate a ""memorandum regarding a potential future peace treaty,"" while again rejecting a 30-day ceasefire.

Over 60% of Americans believe Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""stalling"" peace talks involving the United States, and back weaponry shipments to Ukraine and additional sanctions if Russia refuses to negotiate a peace deal, according to a Harvard CAPS Harris poll released on May 19.

Two-thirds of poll respondents said that they believe Putin is ""playing games and stalling"" in peace deal negotiations involving the United States, with only 34% of respondents believing Putin ""genuinely wants to end the war."" In contrast, 62% of respondents believed President Volodymyr Zelensky wanted to end the war.

A further 62% of respondents also indicated that that the ""Trump administration (should) continue to provide weaponry to Ukraine and impose further economic sanctions on Russia if it refuses to negotiate"" a peace deal, with 38% of respondents against additional weaponry and sanctions.

The survey, which was fielded May 14-15, pre-dates U.S. President Donald Trump's phone call with Putin on May 19.

Following Trump's two-hour phone call with the Russian president, Putin once again did not agree to a ceasefire, instead offering to negotiate a ""memorandum regarding a potential future peace treaty"" with Ukraine.

Trump told reporters in the Oval Office following the phone call that he will not impose further sanctions against Russia ""because there's a chance"" of progress towards a ceasefire

""Because I think there's a chance of getting something done, and if you do that, you could also make it much worse,"" Trump said.

In separate comments to reporters following the phone call, Trump responded that he trusts Putin and believes he wants peace.

Despite Trump's efforts to broker a peace deal, 59% of respondents indicated that they believe Trump is ""not tough enough"" when dealing with Putin, while 31% believed Trump's demeanor with Putin to be ""about right."" A further 10% of respondents said Trump was ""too tough"" with Putin.

Respondents were also relatively split as to whether they believe Trump will successfully negotiate the end of the war, with 58% of respondents saying that Trump will ""not solve"" the war, while 42% of respondents believe Trump will help end the war.

Initially elected on the campaign promise to end the war within ""24 hours,"" Trump has reportedly grown increasingly frustrated at the pace of negotiations. On May 19, Trump reiterated he would abandon efforts to end Russia's war against Ukraine if progress is not made.

""I tell you, big egos involved, but I think something's going to happen. And if it doesn't, I just back away, and they're going to have to keep going,"" Trump said.

The poll was conducted conducted online within the United States, surveying 1,903 registered voters. The poll is deemed accurate +/- 2.2 percentage point, 19 times out of 20.

Lithuania instituted legal proceedings against Belarus in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on May 19, alleging that Minsk is ""facilitating, supporting, and enabling the smuggling of migrants"" into Lithuania.

According to a news release issued by the ICJ, Vilnius alleges that Minsk is behind an influx in illegal border crossings from Belarus into Lithuania, adding that Minsk fails ""to take necessary border measures to prevent and detect the smuggling of migrants and to ensure the security and control of documents.""

Since 2021, Vilnius has accused Minsk of orchestrating a surge in irregular migrant crossings into Lithuania in an effort to destabilize Ukraine's EU and NATO ally.

“(T)he smuggling of migrants through Belarus into Lithuania has caused serious harm to Lithuania’s sovereignty, security, and public order, as well as to the rights and interests of the smuggled migrants themselves, who have been exposed to grave abuses in trying to reach Lithuanian territory,"" Vilnius said in its claim against Minsk.

Despite raising the issue with Belarusian authorities, Vilnius says that Minsk has refused to cooperate to limit illegal migration.

Lithuania previously said in April 2023 that it has has refused entry to 20,000 migrants from Belarus, although that number has significantly grown since. Vilnius previously demanded Minsk pay 120 million euros ($134 million) from Belarus for facilitating the mass crossings.

Lithuania borders Russia's Kaliningrad exclave to the southwest and Belarus to the east and south. Tensions between NATO and Moscow have escalated since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Belarus — who has not yet responded to the proceedings initiated by Lithuania — is one of Russia's staunchest allies and part of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine was launched from its territory.

Moscow has previously been accused of similar tactics, aimed at destabilizing NATO allies in the Baltics.

In response to Helsinki's accession into NATO, Finland has accused neighboring Russia of weaponizing migration by encouraging migrants from countries like Syria and Somalia to cross the border.

As Lithuania continues to strengthen its defenses along its borders with Belarus and Russia, the country announced on May 5 that it will invest 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) over the next decade to install anti-tank mines in order to ""block and slow"" a possible invasion.

Western intelligence agencies have warned of a potential large-scale war in Europe within the next five years, citing Russia's increasingly aggressive posture.

U.S. President Donald Trump on May 19 reiterated he would abandon efforts to end Russia's war against Ukraine if progress is not made.

""I tell you, big egos involved, but I think something's going to happen. And if it doesn't, I just back away, and they're going to have to keep going,"" Trump said.

The U.S. president reiterated earlier remarks that he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to end Russia's war against Ukraine.

""I said, 'When are we going to end this bloodshed, this blood bath?' It’s a blood bath, and I do believe he wants to end it,"" Trump said, referring to his conversation with Putin on May 19.

Trump and Putin held a phone call earlier on May 19 as Ukraine and its allies intensify efforts to end Russia's war. Putin did not agree to a full ceasefire in his phone call with Trump, despite calls from global leaders to do so.

When asked by journalists if he believes Putin wants peace in Ukraine, Trump replied, ""I do.""

When asked by reporters if he trusts Putin, Trump again said, ""I do.""

The call between Trump and Putin comes days after largely inconclusive negotiations in Turkey.

At the May 15 Istanbul talks, Russia sent a delegation of low-level officials and reiterated maximalist demands, including that Ukraine accept the loss of Crimea and four eastern regions.

Instead of a ceasefire, Putin has insisted on negotiating a ""memorandum regarding a potential future peace treaty.""

Kremlin spokesperson Dimitry Peskov said following the phone call that there was ""no timeline"" for preparing a memorandum, Russian state-owned media TASS reported. ""It’s clear that everyone wants to do this as quickly as possible, but of course, the devil is in the details,"" Peskov added.

The EU is preparing an important sanctions package against Russia as Moscow continues to refuse a ceasefire, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a press conference on May 19.

There is an important ""strong EU sanctions package"" underway, Zelensky said at a press briefing attended by the Kyiv Independent, adding that Ukraine is coordinating with the EU to impose harsh penalties on Russia.

Ukraine knows the date that the EU sanctions are expected to be rolled out, the president said, though he did not name the date in his remarks.

Zelensky said Ukraine and the EU also believe the U.S. will prepare additional sanctions against the Kremlin ""when they see fit.""

Allies expect Washington ""to impose sanctions on Russian banks, energy sector,"" Zelensky said.

""This would be an important, strong mechanism,"" he added.

U.S. President Donald Trump spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky in separate phone calls earlier on May 19. Putin did not agree to a full, unconditional ceasefire despite calls from various world leaders to do so.

Trump said he will not impose further sanctions against Russia ""because there's a chance"" of progress towards a ceasefire, he told reporters in the Oval Office later on May 19.

""Because I think there's a chance of getting something done, and if you do that, you could also make it much worse,"" Trump said.

""But there could be a time where that’s going to happen,"" he added.

Trump's comments contradict those of German government spokesperson Stefan Cornelius who said on May 19 that newly proposed EU sanctions are also being coordinated with the U.S. government.

There was a wave of euphoria and relief across Europe following the election of pro-European liberal Nicusor Dan as Romania’s new president.

“For Ukraine — as a neighbour and friend — it is important to have Romania as a reliable partner. And we are confident we will,” said President Volodymyr Zelensky after Dan’s victory. Moldovan President Maia Sandu echoed the sentiment: “Congratulations, dear Nicusor Dan,” she said with visible enthusiasm.

The presidential runoff was closely watched in Kyiv and Chisinau, as Dan faced off against George Simion, a Russia-linked nationalist banned from entering both Moldova and Ukraine.

Dan’s victory, with 53.6% of the vote, surprised many observers. He overcame a significant 20-point deficit from the first round and secured an additional 4.3 million votes in the second round.

Voter turnout exceeded 64%, the highest recorded since 1996, reflecting a highly mobilized electorate.

From activist to president

A former mathematician and Sorbonne PhD, Nicusor Dan began his political ascent as an anti-corruption activist in Bucharest. After a failed attempt to run for mayor in 2012, he entered local politics in 2016, placing second in the mayoral race and securing council seats for his new political movement — the Save Bucharest Union.

That same year, the Save Bucharest Union evolved into the Save Romania Union (USR), which would become a key player in Romanian politics. However, Dan’s liberalism had its limits, he left the party a year later after refusing to support equal rights for same-sex couples.

Running as an independent, Dan won the Bucharest mayoral election in 2020 and was re-elected in 2024. Now, he makes the short journey — just a 40-minute walk — from Bucharest City Hall to the Cotroceni Presidential Palace.

No honeymoon ahead

Despite the enthusiasm from European officials, experts warn that Dan faces immediate and formidable challenges.

There will be “no honeymoon,” Romanian journalist Cătălin Tolontan warned. “Dan has to form a government immediately to manage the country during a time that all economists say is of crisis,” said journalist Magda Gradinaru in an interview with the Kyiv Independent, referring to Romania’s rising inflation and growing budget deficit.

Beyond economic instability, Dan is expected to deliver on promises of institutional reform and anti-corruption efforts. His stated priorities include fixing the budget deficit, bolstering national security, and restoring public trust in government.

Political gridlock

Dan’s victory also highlighted the weakening legitimacy of Romania’s mainstream political parties. “We had a vote that broke the legitimacy of the mainstream parties,” Gradinaru said. “These parties will try to preserve the status quo during coalition negotiations.”

Some believe that if acting President Ilie Bolojan of the National Liberal Party becomes prime minister, he could consolidate enough parliamentary support. But others are less optimistic.

Journalist Sabina Fati pointed out that Dan’s outsider image and anti-establishment rhetoric might complicate efforts to build a governing majority. “Dan said last night that ‘Romania needs new people in politics.’ That will make negotiations harder,” she noted. “If the Social Democratic Party — the largest in parliament with over 25% of seats — does not support him, his presidency may suffer from a deficit of credibility.”

Notably, the Social Democrats abstained from formally endorsing Dan during the runoff.

Divided electorate

Dan has promised to reduce political polarization and expressed “respect” for those who hold different opinions. However, it remains unclear how he plans to regain the trust of citizens who voted for the far-right.

While many voters expressed hope for better wages and pensions, left-wing voices have criticized the dominance of neoliberal policies in Romanian politics, calling instead for progressive taxation and affordable housing.

Political scientist Vladimir Bortun, from Oxford University, underscored the urgency of addressing social inequality. Despite recent economic growth, Romania remains among the most unequal countries in the EU, with 28% of the population at risk of poverty and another 17% experiencing severe material deprivation.

“Despite successive increases in the minimum wage over the past decade, the median wage is barely over five euros an hour — about one-third of the EU average,” Bortun wrote in The New York Times.

(Mihai Barbu/AFP via Getty Images)

Gradinaru believes the country needs a wide-reaching debate about national unity, not just political dialogue. “We need administrative reform and access to education, healthcare, social services, and culture for the socially vulnerable. These are the building blocks of a strong middle class — one that is more resilient to internal and external threats.”

Journalist Ioana Dogioiu offered a sobering warning: if reforms don’t come soon, “this might be the last time Romania dodges a bullet.”",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2215292219.jpg

Key developments on May 19:

After call with Trump, Putin still refuses full ceasefire, again cites Russia's 'root causes' of war in Ukraine

Zelensky dismisses Putin's demand to withdraw troops from 4 Ukrainian regions

Commander of Ukraine's 59th Brigade replaced, media reports

Ukrainian drones destroy Russian radar, supply depots on Black Sea gas platforms, SBU says

Russia continues to refuse to agree to a full ceasefire in Ukraine, with President Vladimir Putin instead prepared to negotiate a ""memorandum regarding a potential future peace treaty,"" he said following a two-hour call with U.S. President Donald Trump on May 19.

Putin said Trump had ""expressed his position regarding the cessation of hostilities, a ceasefire,"" but the Russian president insisted the ""most effective paths towards peace"" were still to be determined.

A source in the President's Office told the Kyiv Independent on May 19 that Ukraine is still pushing for a full, unconditional ceasefire in talks this week with the U.S. president — the key demand pushed by Trump and accepted by Ukraine back in March.

""Agreed with the president of the U.S. that Russia will propose and is ready to work with the Ukrainian side on a memorandum on a possible future peace treaty,"" Putin told reporters after the call.

""It might define a number of positions, for example, the principles of settlement, the timing of a possible peace agreement, and so on, including a possible ceasefire for a certain period of time if the relevant agreements are reached.""

Russia's position in the negotiations remains unchanged and requires ""eliminating the root causes"" of the war, Putin added.

Following the call, the U.S. president said on Truth Social that Russia and Ukraine will ""immediately start"" negotiations toward a ceasefire and an end to the war.

""The conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of,"" Trump wrote.

Trump also claimed that Russia is interested in engaging in large-scale trade with the United States once the war ends.

""There is a tremendous opportunity for Russia to create massive amounts of jobs and wealth. Its potential is unlimited. Likewise, Ukraine can be a great beneficiary on trade, in the process of rebuilding its country,"" he said.

The U.S. president said he had informed President Volodymyr Zelensky about the call with Vladimir Putin, as well as several European leaders.

A source in the President's Office told the Kyiv Independent that Trump and Zelensky spoke twice on the day — once before the scheduled call with Putin and again after it.

The second conversation lasted for over an hour and included Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, French President Emmanuel Macron, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and European Council President Antonio Costa.

Putin's foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, told Russian journalists that the presidents spoke for two hours and five minutes, with no mention of a ceasefire deadline.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov described the phone call between the two presidents as ""productive"" and highlighted Trump's ""neutral"" stance on the war.

Speaking to reporters, Peskov said, ""Trump's position is neutral and he does deal with settlement issues, while the position of European politicians is openly pro-Ukrainian.""

Zelensky dismisses Putin's demand to withdraw troops from 4 Ukrainian regions

Ukraine will not withdraw troops from the territories it controls, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on May 19, rejecting Russian demands put forward by the country's delegation in Istanbul.

""It's our land, we won't withdraw our troops from our territory,"" Zelensky said, responding to a question by the Kyiv Independent. ""This is a constitutional duty of mine, of our military ... No ultimatums, no one will surrender their lands, their people, their homes.""

Zelensky's statement follows inconclusive negotiations in Istanbul on May 16, where Moscow sent a delegation of low-level officials and reiterated sweeping territorial demands, including Kyiv's acceptance of the loss of Crimea and four eastern regions.

A source in the Ukrainian President's Office briefed on the talks told the Kyiv Independent on May 16 that Moscow's delegation insisted that Ukraine retreat from Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, despite Russia not controlling any of them in their entirety.

""It means that they (Russia) don't want peace,"" Zelensky said. ""If they demand what they know we won't agree to. Because they clearly understand that Ukraine will not do it,"" he added.

Russia illegally declared the annexation of the four oblasts following sham referenda in late 2022, incorporating them into its constitution — a move that holds no weight internationally.

Moscow continues to refuse to agree to a full ceasefire. During a call with Trump, Putin said he is prepared to negotiate a ""memorandum regarding a potential future peace treaty.""

Russia's maximalist position in the negotiations remains unchanged and demands ""eliminating the root causes"" of the war, the Russian president added.

Trump's approach to negotiations frustrates European allies, many of whom sought his support for a joint U.S.–EU ultimatum demanding an unconditional ceasefire starting May 12 and tougher sanctions on Moscow.

Despite Russia's refusal, no new U.S. sanctions have been imposed so far.

Commander of Ukraine's 59th Brigade replaced, media reports

Lieutenant Colonel Bohdan Shevchuk was dismissed as the commander of the 59th Brigade of the Unmanned Systems Forces and replaced by Colonel Oleksandr Sak, Ukrainska Pravda reported on May 18, citing its sources in the brigade.

The 59th Brigade, deployed in the Pokrovsk sector in Donetsk Oblast, underwent the emergency leadership change between May 15 and 16 on the order of Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, one military source told the news outlet.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

The brigade's new reported commander, Sak, previously led the 53rd Mechanized Brigade fighting in the Kreminna area.

The reasons behind the move have not been disclosed, though Ukrainska Pravda's sources suggested it could be linked to the worsening situation in the Pokrovsk sector.

The mining town has been the epicenter of some of the heaviest battles in Donetsk Oblast as Russian forces have been trying to capture the strategically important settlement for months.

Syrskyi claimed earlier in May that Ukraine has managed to stabilize the situation in the sector and seize the initiative in some areas.

The 59th Brigade, previously named the 59th Motorized Rifle Brigade, came under Syrskyi's scrutiny in July 2024 after Azovstal defender and medic Kateryna Polishchuk, known under the nickname Ptashka (""bird""), called for an investigation into the unit over Shevchuk's alleged misconduct.

The unit was reorganized into an assault brigade under the Unmanned Systems Forces in January 2025, but retained its commander at the time.

Ukrainian drones destroy Russian radar, supply depots on Black Sea gas platforms, SBU says

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has destroyed a Russian radar system and warehouse facilities located on gas production platforms in the Black Sea using a coordinated drone strike, the agency said on May 19.

According to the SBU, the operation was carried out by the 13th Main Directorate of its Military Counter-Intelligence Department. The mission involved a combination of aerial and naval drones targeting Russian military infrastructure placed on Ukrainian offshore drilling rigs.

An aerial drone allegedly first struck one of the platforms, followed by a naval drone that delivered a secondary hit. The attack destroyed a Russian ""Neva"" radar system used for monitoring aerial and surface activity, as well as supply storage and living quarters on the platform, the SBU reported.

""In a single special operation, our specialists used two types of drones that proved highly effective when working in tandem,"" the agency said.

The SBU noted that the attack is part of an ongoing effort to clear the Black Sea of Russian military presence and equipment. Previous SBU naval drone operations have reportedly targeted the Crimean Bridge and 11 Russian warships.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

The SBU traditionally uses its Sea Baby drones for operations in the Black Sea, while military intelligence (HUR) deploys the Magura naval drones.



In early May, Ukraine shot down two Russian Su-30 fighter jets using air-to-air missiles fired from Magura-7 naval drones and two Russian Mi-8 helicopters in December 2024.

The Magura drones also sank the Russian patrol ship Sergey Kotov on March 5, 2024, and the landing ship Caesar Kunikov on Feb. 14, 2024.

As of 2024, Ukraine was reportedly able to destroy or disable one-third of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in a drone and missile campaign, despite Moscow's significant advantage in sheer naval power.

The European Union will propose this week that Group of Seven (G7) finance ministers reduce the current $60-per-barrel cap on Russian seaborne oil exports, European Economic Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said on May 19, according to Reuters.

Brussels and its allies seek to further reduce the Kremlin's revenue from fossil fuel exports, a key funding source for its war against Ukraine. Dombrovskis confirmed the EU will formally raise the issue during this week's G7 finance ministers' meeting in Canada.

""This is something which we flagged from the Commission's side in the context of the 18th sanctions package,"" Dombrovskis said. ""I would expect some interest also from other G7 partners in this regard and some discussion.""

The G7 oil price cap, established in December 2022, prevents Western companies from shipping, insuring, or providing related services for Russian crude sold above $60 per barrel. EU officials told Reuters that a $50 per barrel proposal would be made at the upcoming meeting.

Western leaders are concerned that the existing cap has lost effectiveness as Russia reroutes exports through a ""shadow fleet"" of tankers operating outside regular maritime oversight.

The fleet enables Moscow to bypass the cap and sell oil above the threshold, including to countries in Asia. Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul on May 17 said the EU would back expanded sanctions targeting this shadow fleet.

The Kremlin's budget is increasingly strained by soaring military expenditures, with Russia's Finance Ministry relying heavily on energy revenues to maintain operations and fund continued aggression against Ukraine.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg

U.S. President Donald Trump has been clear that he aims to see direct talks between Russia and Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on May 19 during a press briefing in Kyiv.

The Ukrainian and Russian delegations held direct talks for the first time since 2022 on May 16. They concluded without a breakthrough.

During the talks, Moscow demanded that Kyiv withdraw its troops from four partially occupied Ukrainian oblasts that Russia illegally claims as its own — Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson.

""For Trump, the most important thing is direct talks between Ukraine and Russia,"" Zelensky said, adding that Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and Russian President Vladimir Putin's adviser, Vladimir Medinsky, held a call on May 19 and discussed a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange.

The exchange will happen ""in the next days or weeks,"" and civilians will not be included in the list, according to Zelensky.

In the meantime, Ukraine also wants to discuss with Russia the release of Ukrainian political prisoners and journalists, the president added.

Speaking about a potential ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia, Zelensky said Russia will deliver a memorandum with its proposals.

Zelensky added that during a call with U.S. President Donald Trump on May 19, he asked for three things: a ceasefire, the agility to present the Ukrainian view on the memorandum and for decisions ""to be agreed on Ukraine without Ukraine.""

Zelensky had a call with Trump before the latter was to talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

After speaking with Trump, Putin again refused to accept a comprehensive ceasefire and said that Russia's position in the negotiations remains unchanged and requires ""eliminating the root causes"" of the war.

Kremlin spokesperson Dimitry Peskov said following the phone call that there was ""no timeline"" for preparing a memorandum, Russian state-owned media TASS reported. ""It’s clear that everyone wants to do this as quickly as possible, but of course, the devil is in the details,"" Peskov added.

Reacting to the Putin-Trump call, Zelensky stressed that Ukraine will not withdraw its troops from the partially Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories, as the Russian delegation previously demanded in Istanbul.

President Volodymyr Zelensky on May 19 said that Kyiv is exploring the possibility of a meeting with delegations from Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and the EU in Turkey, the Vatican, or Switzerland, he announced at a press briefing attended by the Kyiv Independent.

""We are considering a meeting of all the teams. We want to organize it at a high level. The United States, Ukraine, Russia, some EU representatives, and the United Kingdom,"" he said.

""Such a meeting could take place in Turkey, the Vatican, or Switzerland. We are considering these three venues. The question is not about comfort, but who will be able to organize a meeting with an appropriate result.""

The statement comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin held a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, during which he continued to refuse to agree to a full ceasefire, instead stating he is prepared to negotiate a ""memorandum regarding a potential future peace treaty.""

The Russian delegation at the peace talks consisted only of lower-ranking officials, raising doubts about Moscow's commitment to ending the war, despite the Kremlin proposing the discussions.

Zelensky's statement follows a phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump in which they discussed the conditions for a potential end to Russia's war in Ukraine.

These calls follow inconclusive negotiations in Istanbul on May 16, where Moscow sent a delegation of low-level officials and reiterated sweeping territorial demands, including Kyiv's acceptance of the loss of Crimea and four eastern regions.

A source in the Ukrainian President's Office briefed on the talks told the Kyiv Independent on May 16 that Moscow's delegation insisted that Ukraine retreat from Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, despite Russia not controlling any of them in their entirety.

""It means that they (Russia) don't want peace,"" Zelensky said. ""If they demand what they know we won't agree to. Because they clearly understand that Ukraine will not do it,"" he added.

Russia illegally declared the annexation of the four oblasts following sham referenda in late 2022, incorporating them into its constitution — a move that holds no weight internationally.

Moscow continues to refuse to agree to a full ceasefire. During a call with Trump, Putin said he is prepared to negotiate a ""memorandum regarding a potential future peace treaty.""

Russia's maximalist position in the negotiations remains unchanged and demands ""eliminating the root causes"" of the war, the Russian president added.

A source in the President's Office told the Kyiv Independent on May 19 that Ukraine is still advocating for a full, unconditional ceasefire in talks this week with the U.S. president — the key demand pushed by Trump and accepted by Ukraine back in March.

The U.S. president's approach to negotiations frustrates European allies, many of whom sought his support for a joint U.S.–EU ultimatum demanding an unconditional ceasefire starting May 12 and tougher sanctions on Moscow.

Latest: 'It's our land' — Zelensky responds to Putin's call with Trump, Russia's Ukraine ceasefire demands

Russia continues to refuse to agree to a full ceasefire in Ukraine, with President Vladimir Putin instead prepared to negotiate a ""memorandum regarding a potential future peace treaty,"" he said following a two-hour call with U.S. President Donald Trump on May 19.

Putin said Trump had ""expressed his position regarding the cessation of hostilities, a ceasefire,"" but the Russian president insisted the ""most effective paths towards peace"" were still to be determined.

A source in the President's Office told the Kyiv Independent on May 19 that Ukraine is still pushing for a full, unconditional ceasefire in talks this week with the U.S. president — the key demand pushed by Trump and accepted by Ukraine back in March.

""Agreed with the president of the U.S. that Russia will propose and is ready to work with the Ukrainian side on a memorandum on a possible future peace treaty,"" Putin told reporters after the call.

""It might define a number of positions, for example, the principles of settlement, the timing of a possible peace agreement, and so on, including a possible ceasefire for a certain period of time if the relevant agreements are reached.""

Russia's position in the negotiations remains unchanged and requires ""eliminating the root causes"" of the war, Putin added.

Following the call, the U.S. president said on Truth Social that Russia and Ukraine will ""immediately start"" negotiations toward a ceasefire and an end to the war.

""The conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of,"" Trump wrote.

Kremlin spokesperson Dimitry Peskov said following the phone call that there was ""no timeline"" for preparing a memorandum, Russian state-owned media TASS reported. ""It’s clear that everyone wants to do this as quickly as possible, but of course, the devil is in the details,"" Peskov added.

Trump also claimed that Russia is interested in engaging in large-scale trade with the United States once the war ends.

""There is a tremendous opportunity for Russia to create massive amounts of jobs and wealth. Its potential is unlimited. Likewise, Ukraine can be a great beneficiary on trade, in the process of rebuilding its country,"" he said.

The U.S. president said he had informed President Volodymyr Zelensky about the call with Vladimir Putin, as well as several European leaders.

A source in the President's Office told the Kyiv Independent that Trump and Zelensky spoke twice on the day — once before the scheduled call with Putin and again after it.

The second conversation lasted for over an hour and included Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, French President Emmanuel Macron, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and European Council President Antonio Costa.

Putin's foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, told Russian journalists that the presidents spoke for two hours and five minutes, with no mention of a ceasefire deadline.

The call comes days after largely inconclusive negotiations in Istanbul, where Russia sent a delegation of low-level officials and reiterated sweeping territorial demands, including that Ukraine accept the loss of Crimea and four eastern regions.

The negotiations in Istanbul concluded without a breakthrough. The two parties agreed to a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange this week. Ukrainian and European officials have expressed frustration over what they view as Moscow's unwillingness to engage in serious peace efforts.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov described the phone call between the two presidents as ""productive"" and highlighted Trump's ""neutral"" stance on the war.

Speaking to reporters, Peskov said, ""Trump's position is neutral and he does deal with settlement issues, while the position of European politicians is openly pro-Ukrainian.""

The U.S. president's approach to negotiations frustrates European allies, many of whom sought his support for a joint U.S.–EU ultimatum demanding an unconditional ceasefire starting May 12 and tougher sanctions on Moscow.

Despite Russia's refusal, no new U.S. sanctions have been imposed so far.

In Washington, Republican lawmakers have echoed the call for punitive actions against Moscow. U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg told Fox Business that the ""Russian Sanctions Act of 2025 is ready to go.""

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on May 1 that the legislation includes sweeping financial penalties and 500% tariffs on countries that continue buying Russian oil, gas, or uranium.

During their previous phone call on March 18, Putin also rejected Trump's 30-day ceasefire offer but announced a pause on strikes against energy facilities, which Ukraine claims was repeatedly violated.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2215424493.jpg

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

U.S. President Donald Trump held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 19, marking their first known conversation in two months.

According to Russia’s state-owned news agency TASS, the call lasted approximately two and a half hours. Reuters reported that the Russian president was speaking from Russia's Black Sea resort in Sochi, while Trump was in Washington.

The call comes days after largely inconclusive negotiations in Istanbul, where Russia sent a delegation of low-level officials and reiterated sweeping territorial demands, including that Ukraine accept the loss of Crimea and four eastern regions.

U.S. Vice President JD Vance said on May 19 that Trump intends to press Putin on whether he is genuinely interested in ending the war against Ukraine during their phone call.

""We realize there's a bit of an impasse here,"" Vance said from Italy, where he had attended the Vatican inauguration of Pope Leo XIV. ""And I think the president's going to say to President Putin: 'Look, are you serious? Are you real about this?'""

Shortly before the call, Moscow sought to downplay expectations. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that resolving Russia's war against Ukraine will involve ""painstaking and lengthy work,"" as reported by the state-run news agency TASS.

The negotiations in Istanbul concluded without a breakthrough, though the two parties agreed to a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange this week.

Ukrainian and European officials have expressed frustration over what they see as Moscow’s refusal to engage in serious peace efforts.

After Russia proposed to hold peace talks in Turkey, President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed and invited Putin for a face-to-face meeting. The Russian leader declined to attend and appointed his aide, Vladimir Medinsky, to lead the talks.

Trump said that no real progress can be made without a direct meeting between himself and Putin.

""Nothing's going to happen until Putin and I get together,"" the U.S. president told reporters on May 15. He later added, ""I think it's time for us to just do it.""

Trump has downplayed Putin's absence at the Istanbul talks, saying, ""Why would he go if I'm not going?"" while positioning himself as a central broker in the peace effort.

The U.S. president has been inconsistent in his rhetoric toward the Russian leader, at times voicing frustration with the stalled peace efforts but mostly avoiding direct criticism of Putin.

Despite U.S. efforts, Putin has shown little willingness to compromise to achieve a settlement. A breakthrough in the call with Trump is unlikely as the Kremlin's chief believes Russian forces can continue making progress on the battlefield, Bloomberg reported, citing an undisclosed source.

Trump's approach has caused frustration and confusion among European allies, many of whom wanted him to back a joint U.S.–EU ultimatum for an unconditional ceasefire starting May 12 and tougher sanctions on Moscow. Despite Russia's refusal, no additional U.S. sanctions have so far been imposed.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron, and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer were scheduled to hold a preparatory call with Trump ahead of his conversation with Putin.

Trump is also expected to call Zelensky after talking with his Russian counterpart.

The U.S. president has often boasted about his supposedly warm ties with the Russian leader, though the two have not met since Trump returned to office this January.

The two presidents previously held a phone call on March 18, during which Putin rejected Trump's Kyiv-backed offer for a 30-day ceasefire but declared a pause on strikes against energy facilities, which Ukraine said was repeatedly violated.

Trump has adopted a more critical rhetoric toward the Kremlin recently amid Moscow's delays in peace negotiations and continued attacks on civilian areas in Ukraine.

At the same time, the new U.S. administration has also often used a scathing tone toward Ukraine, most notably during an explosive meeting between Trump and Zelensky in the White House in February. The two leaders held a second meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis's funeral in April, which was described by both parties in more positive terms.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-632916138.jpg

Editor’s note: In accordance with newsroom policy on reporting on children and the policies of organizations interviewed, the Kyiv Independent is not using the names of children under 18 or the last names of their parents who appear in this story.

When the children arrive at a basement shelter in the Savyntsi Community Center, psychologist Olena Husman, in her blonde bob and tortoise-shell glasses, stoops down to greet a young girl in pigtails with a high five.

As Husman and another psychologist lead the elementary school-aged children in dancing to children's songs on this cloudy April day, one by one, the kids warm up and remove their coats.

""Good morning, the sun says hello! Good morning, the sky is blue! Good morning, there are birds in the sky!""

The youngest is four years old, and the kids spin with airplane arms and hop around like frogs to music played from a Bluetooth speaker. A glowing space heater keeps the room warm, while sheets and hand-drawn cartoons hang from the pipes, decorating the cement walls that protect them from aerial attacks.

Savyntsi, a community 85 kilometers southeast of Kharkiv, survived heavy shelling and six months of occupation in 2022. Residents were tortured and disappeared, and many families fled. Home to around 10,000 before the full-scale invasion began, less than a quarter of the population remained when the occupation ended. Children who stayed behind spent much of the time hiding from Russian troops who occupied their town.

Many returned home since Ukrainian forces pushed back Russian troops during the Kharkiv counteroffensive. Today, Savyntsi has 5,850 residents, including 697 children.

""It is very important that our children still have a childhood, even if it was partially stolen by military aggression,"" says Liliia Novoselska, the village council’s chief education department specialist. ""The children were under occupation for a long time, sitting in basements.""

""As the head of our military administration says: 'We were able to pull the children out of the basements, but it is very difficult to get the basements out of their heads.'""

“It is very important that our children still have a childhood, even if it was partially stolen by military aggression.” Liliia Novoselska, Savyntsi’s chief education department specialist, is seen during an interview at a school in Savyntsi, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine, on April 1, 2025.

Four days a week, teams from SOS Children’s Villages Ukraine — a non-governmental charitable organization focused on supporting children and young people without parental care or at risk of losing it — bring mental health services to children in various rural settlements. These small communities closer to the battle lines often have the least access to mental healthcare in all of Ukraine, yet have been exposed to some of the most traumatic conditions of the war.

Although it's just after 10 a.m. during the team's weekly session in Savyntsi, it's impossible to tell this in the underground room with no windows. Behind the dancing children, a social worker meets with parents to tell them about their programs and ask if they need help obtaining things like dishes or rain boots, while another psychologist counsels parents individually and in groups nearby.

The children jump and clap their hands together, singing the worldwide mega-hit kids song ""Baby Shark,"" while the shyest kids hide under a table until they’re comfortable enough to join the group. One boy has walked an hour with his mother from an area with little public transport to attend. Later in the day, older groups of middle schoolers and teenagers will arrive.

More than 6 million Ukrainians are estimated to have left the country since the full-scale invasion, often leaving behind their homes and possessions while taking with them their talents and expertise.

The local government of Savyntsi, like those of many other communities in the country, has been working to encourage families to stay in the village and help rebuild their community and their homeland, Novoselska tells the Kyiv Independent. Bringing in child psychologists is part of this effort, as the community has none of its own.

""We will not be able to live another life, we will not get another chance,"" Novoselska says. ""We adults must do everything as best as possible so that our children are happy.""

One of Ukraine's biggest challenges

Husman estimates she spends at least five hundred hours each year in the back of their white van stamped with the SOS Children's Villages logo. Her team members, a group of six psychologists and specialists, sway against one another on sharp turns and potholes in their native Kharkiv Oblast.

They pass buildings struck by glide bombs and through military checkpoints, until buildings give way to woods and then to fields of dark soil surrounded by small red signs warning of landmines.

Husman, now 53, spent nearly two decades as a teacher, then almost another decade as a private practice psychologist working with children with special needs. Her current work with SOS Children's Villages rings close to home as a mother and native of the region herself.

""I’m still not used to it,"" Husman says. ""You see the eyes of these children. Here, there are displaced families, orphaned children, maybe someone’s parents just died recently. You look at these children, and they are still living on the front lines. They have a chance for a different life, but they all hide when the Shaheds (kamikaze drones) fly. How can you get used to this?""

Addressing mental health problems will be one of Ukraine’s biggest challenges in the coming years, the country’s social policy minister told the Kyiv Independent in March.

A World Health Organization survey found in 2024 that psychological distress is the most prevalent health issue in the country. Nearly half of Ukrainians face some sort of mental health concern, according to WHO data. Those numbers rise to around three-quarters or more in regions closest to the front lines, including Kharkiv. According to Health Ministry data, the most common reasons for Ukrainians to seek mental health treatment are anxiety, sleep disorders, depression, and problems with memory.

Psychologists working with children and their caretakers say Ukraine’s youth have also fallen behind on socializing with others their age, especially near the front lines, where schooling is held remotely and children in some communities spent months in hiding.

""There’s a desire to communicate, but the skills are missing,"" says Husman. ""And there is often another problem: they can’t be organized."" In large groups, children lag behind their usual age group's ability to follow directions, she explains: ""They don't understand structure.""

SOS Children’s Villages has multiple teams working in different oblasts, making weekly visits to the villages they serve. With the help of glitter, clay, markers, music, and games, the team designs tailored activities for each group to help the kids communicate with one another and express their feelings.

The third group of children who visit the shelter in Savyntsi are teenagers. On this particular day, they are making collages depicting their dreams of the future and presenting them to the rest of the group. One boy, who dreams of visiting London, uses a glue stick to paste a British flag next to a cartoon of Big Ben. Two girls look at pictures of perfume, while another boy chooses an image of an expensive necklace. He wants to buy his future wife jewelry, he explains.

“In the Soviet Union, psychiatric hospitals and psychiatry in general were punitive. It was a way to combat people who were against the communists.”

Olena, a resident of Savyntsi with seven children, arrives at the basement to pick up her young daughter. After the war began, her eldest son, a teenager, closed himself off and ""doesn’t share much,"" she says. Her eight-year-old daughter began stuttering in class with fear, but ""can’t say what she’s afraid of.""

Since several of her kids began attending the weekly classes, she’s seen them opening up more with their peers. ""When the women began coming to us, (my kids) were afraid. They were hiding, scared. Now they’re not as afraid,"" she says, before taking her daughter home.

Post-Soviet destigmatization

""In the Soviet Union, psychiatric hospitals and psychiatry in general were punitive. It was a way to combat people who were against the communists,"" says Yuliia Okhmat, deputy coordinator for the mental health and psychosocial support division of the global medical aid organization International Medical Corps (IMC). ""That’s not the case now in Ukraine, but it takes time to dispel this myth — especially among older people.""

Since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, nonprofits, government ministries, and international agencies have joined forces to find new ways to treat Ukraine’s unseen wounds. Therapists, psychologists, and social workers have been integrated into teams that deploy as rapid response to strike sites, one-time community health visits, and long-term outreach to remote areas with few services. Hundreds of mobile teams are currently deployed across the country, carrying out consultations with both children and adults.

Adults, however, are often more resistant to accepting services. While mental health support is stigmatized in many countries for many different reasons, Ukraine has the additional barrier of its past.

Researchers estimate that tens of thousands of people deemed to be dissidents were imprisoned in psychiatric ""hospitals"" during the 1960s to 1980s Soviet Union, where patients were beaten and given psychiatric medications like haloperidol as torture and control. Russian forces have recently revived the practice of punitive psychiatry in the occupied Ukrainian territories.

The IMC has been working to dispel shame and misconceptions around treatment both by visiting communities and gaining their trust over time and by supporting national communication campaigns. It has carried out more than 30,000 mental health consultations since the outbreak of the full-scale invasion and trains health care workers and community leaders in mental health techniques, from stress management to how to treat elder populations struggling with mental health.

""When we go to train educators and social workers, sometimes we see that they are scared to even utter the word suicide,"" Okhmat says.

Okhmat, who was working in the Donbas region of Ukraine prior to the full-scale invasion, says she’s noticed that people are now more open to receiving mental health services than they were nearly a decade ago when Russian aggression began. ""But there is still a long way to go to combat stigma,"" she adds.

Bringing the clinic to the village

The volunteers with the Israeli-Ukrainian nonprofit FRIDA have found creative ways to convince Ukrainians to take advantage of their mental health services.

The organization brings together doctors of various specialties on the weekends to staff one-day clinics in areas of Ukraine with limited access to medical care, including front-line communities. Many of their patients are elderly villagers with strong ties to the land or insufficient funds to relocate to safer places. The arrival of the energetic young team is often an important event for these villages: residents often dress up for the day.

When the FRIDA team arrives in Kamiane, a rural settlement in Zaporizhzhia Oblast about 38 km (24 miles) from the front line, a crowd of villagers begins to form outside the Soviet-style two-story cement brick building more than an hour before the clinic opens. Most are pensioners, milling about and catching up with neighbors.

— Do you have trouble sleeping?

— Just when they’re bombing us.

Inside, a team composed of more than a dozen specialists is a whirlwind of movement, transforming the space into an extensive hospital with the equipment from their ambulance. Stacked boxes of pills and prescription glasses are unloaded in a row to create a makeshift pharmacy. Signs are taped to different doors marking the doctors behind them — cardiologist, oncologist, gynecologist, neurologist are among them — and an intake area just inside the entrance is set up with laptops and forms to greet the arriving patients.

When the doors open, the first villagers approach the desks to fill out forms and list the doctors they are here to see. The most popular are the cardiologist and ophthalmologist, while practically no one shows up asking for mental health treatment.

But after patients complete their intake, the doctors wave them toward a soft-spoken young woman sitting on a wooden chair in the corner with a laptop across her knees. While waiting for their doctors, each patient is asked to answer a survey of ten questions, though its true purpose isn't advertised.

""Do you have trouble sleeping?"" asks Anastasiia Tsyubchenko, a psychologist and therapist who specializes in trauma. “Do you ever feel anxious or experience panic attacks?”

""Just when they’re bombing us,"" responds an older woman with trembling hands in a white knitted cap.

Tsyubchenko was working in human resources when the full-scale invasion broke out, but watching her country rally for its survival motivated her to go back to school for a psychology degree. Now, during the work week, she treats veterans, civilians, and families of military personnel. Her visit to Kamiane is her sixth weekend volunteering with FRIDA, having also joined missions in Sumy, Donetsk, Kherson, and Chernihiv oblasts.

On the volunteer missions, they often encounter emotions of people in crisis, she says. ""When relatives are on the contact line at the front, it’s very difficult, especially for mothers and wives. They have constant stress. When a relative dies, they grieve. Here, too, people live in these front-line regions with constant explosions, constant threats. They see it all, hear it all. It is more acute for them.""

When she asks one man in a worn brown cap whether there are events that intrude on his thoughts or that he can’t stop thinking about, he begins to tear up. After he responds ""yes"" to more than four of the screening questions, she recommends he return for an individual counseling session with her later in the afternoon. Because mental health relief is rarely an immediate fix, FRIDA directs people to partner organizations that offer a course of 10-12 remote sessions at no cost to the patient.

""People sometimes do not entirely understand their situation themselves, or do not feel that they need psychological treatment, even when concerns are significant and affecting their health,"" says Olena Poskanna, who heads FRIDA’s mental health division. ""That’s why we introduced the patient survey.""

High rates of anxiety, depression

While FRIDA's work in Sumy and Zaporizhzhia is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and carried out by GIZ Ukraine, other organizations are less lucky. Other mobile health clinics that were dependent on USAID money have halted their operations.

“Around 85% of patients come (to the neurologist) and they’re sure that the problem is in the spine, that the problem is somewhere else, and not in their mental health.”

Last year, FRIDA volunteers treated more than 13,000 patients for different medical issues across 76 missions. The organization's mental health division screened more than 3,500 front-line residents. A preliminary data analysis by the organization found that just over two-thirds of respondents had symptoms that led its specialists to recommend additional counseling.

Olena Mazurenko, a neurologist who has participated in nearly three dozen FRIDA missions in two years, says many patients seek her out to treat physical symptoms without realizing their cause is depression or anxiety.

""Around 85% of patients come and they’re sure that the problem is in the spine, that the problem is somewhere else, and not in their mental health,"" says Mazurenko. ""The patient may not feel or recognize that they have anxiety, but will have issues with their nervous system.""

With careful questions and physical evaluations, she teases out the underlying cause of the residents' ailments. If medication is needed, she will write an initial prescription and walk them through how to speak to their local doctors for follow-up treatment. The process can include coaching patients through their fears.

“I had 35 patients today, and somewhere around 28 or 29 had anxiety disorder. The most popular (medicine) boxes are mine.”

Over the course of the day in Kamiane, more than a hundred villagers cycle through the building, seeing an average of three doctors during their visit. The hallways are filled with elderly patients waiting for their turn to see the specialists.

Although few arrive seeking mental health treatment, when the volunteers begin taking down the signs and packing up boxes at the end of the day, Mazurenko points to the pharmacy. The pile of anxiety and depression medicines has dwindled.

President Volodymyr Zelensky met with top officials on May 19 to evaluate the outcome of Ukraine-Russia negotiations held in Istanbul last week, the president announced on Telegram.

The Istanbul talks marked the first direct encounter between Ukrainian and Russian delegations since 2022. The meeting took place hours before a scheduled phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, who led Ukraine's delegation in Turkey, briefed Zelensky on the discussion.

""The meetings on May 15–16 demonstrated to the world our readiness to bring peace closer and, accordingly, the need to put pressure on Russia to end the war,"" Zelensky wrote.

The Russian delegation at the peace talks consisted solely of lower-ranking officials, despite the Kremlin proposing the discussions.

Zelensky said the most tangible result of the talks was an agreement to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war (POWs) from each side. Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) has already begun preparatory steps to facilitate the transfer.

""The Ukrainian delegation managed to keep the conversation within a decent framework. All attempts of Russian threats were rejected,"" Zelensky added.

""Ukraine insists on the need for a complete and unconditional ceasefire to save lives and to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy.""

A source in the President's Office told the Kyiv Independent on May 16 that Russia's delegation pushed Kyiv to withdraw from Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts — all of which Moscow claimed to annex in 2022, though it does not fully control any of them.

Ukraine accepted a U.S.-proposed 30-day unconditional ceasefire in March and has reiterated that it remains open to a leaders-level meeting to address key issues.

""We are ready for this. Ukraine is not afraid of direct negotiations with Russia,"" Zelensky added.

He also announced the formation of a ""permanent expanded national negotiating group"" to work alongside international partners, whom he thanked for their support.

Despite calls for diplomacy, Russia escalated its attacks over the weekend, including the war's largest drone assault on May 18, when 273 drones entered Ukrainian airspace. The same day, Zelensky met with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the Vatican to discuss sanctions, diplomacy, and battlefield coordination.

President Trump, who has resisted imposing new sanctions on Moscow so far, is scheduled to speak with Putin on May 19. He has said he will follow up with calls to Zelensky and NATO leaders.

The German government supports newly proposed European Union sanctions, which are being coordinated with the U.S. government, spokesperson Stefan Cornelius said on May 19, Tagesshau reported.

The proposed sanctions would involve measures targeting the Nord Stream gas pipelines, the spokesperson added.

""The federal government supports the elements that affect Nord Stream,"" Cornelius said in response to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's announcement of new punitive measures. He added that Washington's participation in a potential sanctions package would be ""very central.""

""Chancellor (Friedrich) Merz is working with U.S. and European partners on new sanctions against Russia,"" Cornelius reportedly said, adding that ""the intention of these sanctions is to achieve agreement from Russia to an unconditional truce.""

Von der Leyen called for new sanctions against Russia after President Vladimir Putin failed to attend Ukraine-Russia peace talks in Istanbul. The new package would include sanctions on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, additional listings of vessels from Russia's shadow fleet, a lower oil price cap, and sanctions on Russia's financial sector.

The absence of Russia's top leadership from the Istanbul negotiations — proposed by the Kremlin but attended only by lower-ranking aides — was widely viewed as a signal that Moscow remains unwilling to engage in meaningful talks.

Previously, President Volodymyr Zelensky and the leaders of the U.K., France, Germany, and Poland have pledged to impose additional sanctions against Russia if the Kremlin does not accept their proposal for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.

Last week, EU members agreed on the bloc's 17th sanctions package, which primarily targeted Russia's ""shadow fleet"" and came under criticism for not being ""as strong as it should be.""

Although Nord Stream 2 was never activated, and Nord Stream 1 ceased operation after suspected sabotage in 2022, sanctions on the pipelines would carry a symbolic value. They would also close loopholes and prevent future attempts to revive Russian energy exports to Europe.

The media previously reported that pro-Moscow figures have contacted the Trump administration to resume the operation of the Nord Stream pipelines, a step that would require European nations to agree.

In Washington, the U.S. Senate is preparing its own response to Russia's delays. U.S. lawmakers have advanced the ""Russian Sanctions Act of 2025,"" which includes sweeping measures such as 500% tariffs on countries that continue to buy Russian energy products. At least 72 senators reportedly support the bill.

European leaders are also expected to call U.S. President Donald Trump ahead of his planned phone conversation with Putin on May 19. The U.S. president has repeatedly floated the idea of imposing additional sanctions on Russia to pressure it toward a peace deal, but has yet to take the step.

Trump announced that he plans to speak with Putin on May 19, after which he will hold a call with Zelensky. Trump said he hopes the discussions will result in a ceasefire — a step the Kremlin has doggedly resisted since the U.S. first proposed a 30-day truce in March.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2214851404.jpg

In October of last year, just days before the U.S. presidential election, Head of the McCain Institute Evelyn Farkas told the Kyiv Independent that a Donald Trump victory would be the ""worst-case scenario"" for Ukraine.

In the months since, a victorious Trump has taken office, dismantled the global post-World War II security architecture, blamed President Volodymyr Zelensky for starting Russia's full-scale invasion, and left Ukraine in limbo, all without securing a peace deal.

The Kyiv Independent sat down with Farkas at the Kyiv Security Forum on May 8 to ask her if that worst-case scenario had come true, or if there was still some hope left for Ukraine.

Dr. Evelyn Farkas, executive director of the McCain Institute. (McCain Institute)

The Kyiv Independent: When we last spoke, you said a Trump election victory was the ""worst-case scenario"" for Ukraine — are we now in it?

Evelyn Farkas: I imagined an administration that turned its back on Ukraine. And we aren't there yet.

It remains to be seen ultimately what position the United States takes. Our government has not clearly delineated — aside from saying that we want to make peace — what our position is on the definition of peace.

It seems to me it’s part of a negotiating strategy — where you don't tell anyone what you really want and you confuse everyone.

It's not a negotiation strategy that I would employ (but) it could potentially work. But it does, of course, make people nervous about what the ultimate objective is because it hasn't been clarified.

If the ultimate objective is not to support Ukraine, then that is the worst-case scenario because it means that Russia will not be stopped.

Russia will then turn its aggressive attention to other neighboring states — first the ones that used to be part of the Soviet empire, and then it will threaten Europe, and ultimately the United States.

The Kyiv Independent: Have you noticed a shift in rhetoric from the White House in recent weeks towards Russia?

Evelyn Farkas: As I've said all along, my view is to stay open-minded and give the administration the benefit of the doubt until they make some definitive statement one way or the other. Then we can judge it.

Vladimir Putin doesn't want an end to the war because it will likely mean the end of his political existence, if not his actual existence.

But right now, I am encouraged by the fact that the vice president and even the president have indicated impatience with Putin.

And maybe there's a dawning realization that in this world that Vladimir Putin is not stronger after Prigozhin marched on Moscow, and he's weaker economically, politically, militarily, and heavily dependent on China.

In this world, Vladimir Putin doesn't want an end to the war because it will likely mean the end of his political existence, if not his actual existence, because there will be a lot of angry veterans running around Moscow and St. Petersburg.

The Kyiv Independent: Why do you think it has taken the White House so long to realize this?

Evelyn Farkas: Probably because there are competing interests. There are those who really want to bring the war to an end and do it in a way that's sustainable, that looks like a victory for the president, not a defeat. Because there are some versions of a peace agreement that would look like a defeat for President Trump and for the United States.

And then there are others who are interested in making deals with the Russian elites, Putin and his oligarchs. And the people interested in making deals probably have the upper hand.

And so initially, at least, I think the impatience and the overwhelming desire to make business deals were impacting their diplomacy more in the beginning.

And now it seems that the reality is becoming understood — you can't just go and make business deals. You can't just quickly make peace so you can make business deals. That's not going to work.

The Kyiv Independent: How much has this peace process been driven by people's personal interests rather than America's interests?

Evelyn Farkas: It's hard to say from the outside, but it is disconcerting to see a lack of a clear separation between the governance, the business of the American people, and the special interests of people working in the administration.

The Kyiv Independent: What do you think of U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff's performance?

Evelyn Farkas: I think he was a peculiar choice because he's not a seasoned diplomat, and I don't really know whether he's a seasoned business deal broker either.

And so he seems to have been enlisted to try to maybe charm Putin and entice him with some offers, perhaps business offers. But that hasn't worked.

The Kyiv Independent: Do you think that Witkoff was the one who was charmed?

Evelyn Farkas: I can't say, I don't know him. Of course, he was repeating things the Kremlin told him, and we know that the Kremlin sells a bunch of propaganda and lies.

So he was either charmed by them, or for some other reason, he felt like he needed to repeat their propaganda and really omit some of the truth when he spoke publicly.

The Kyiv Independent: Here in Ukraine, at some moments during Trump's term, it has seemed like the U.S. might not only abandon Ukraine, but outright betray it by giving Russia everything that it wants — was that felt by Ukraine supporters in the U.S.?

Evelyn Farkas: I think for pro-Ukraine people in the United States, there was a lot of concern around statements like 'Ukraine can't ever become part of NATO', that 'Crimea was always Russian.’

Those kinds of statements are a betrayal of Ukraine and its interests.

And frankly, they are a betrayal of our interests, because our interest is in stopping Putin's neo-imperial aggression, and getting a just, lasting peace for Ukraine.

""The American people feel very clearly that Ukraine was and is the victim, and Russia was and is the aggressor. And that is not articulated clearly from the White House.""

So, yes, we were alarmed by those statements because they seemed to indicate that that was the private negotiating position of the administration. Again, not a lot has been made public.

And of course, when the issue of the Coalition of the Willing was raised by the Europeans, led by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the reaction from the White House was non-committal. And that's also disturbing because you can't have a deterrence of Putin, and that is to say, a lasting peace for Ukraine, without the United States military to back it up.

The Kyiv Independent: Do you think Trump and Zelensky's relationship is OK now, or could we see it revert to a time similar to the infamous Oval Office showdown?

Evelyn Farkas: You can't rule it out. I was shocked by the treatment of President Zelensky in the White House. It was appalling.

I think a lot of it is tactics, although, of course, Trump (does) seem to have this preference for Russia over Ukraine that goes all the way back to the 80s when he visited Moscow.

The Kyiv Independent: What can Democrats do, if anything, right now to help Ukraine?

Evelyn Farkas: Continue to work with Republicans who want to support Ukraine.

(Republican Senator) Lindsey Graham has a sanctions bill that has a veto-proof majority. There should be more efforts like that, more bipartisan legislation.

The Democrats... I wish sometimes they would be more honest about things that we did wrong, things that we might have done better, in order to actually give the Republicans an incentive to do more right now in Ukraine.

Politicians rarely do that, though.

And the last thing that they can do is continue to speak to their constituents. And then listen to their constituents, because there are a lot of constituents who care and who want America to do the right thing when it comes to Ukraine and other places in the world.

The Kyiv Independent: Do you get the sense that American public opinion differs very wildly from the opinions that we get out of the White House on Ukraine?

Evelyn Farkas: Yes. The polls show that there's still a majority of Americans in favor of supporting Ukraine.

But in the White House, it's unclear. And I think the American people feel very clearly that Ukraine was and is the victim, and Russia was and is the aggressor.

That is not articulated clearly from the White House.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2214559333.jpg

President Volodymyr Zelensky on May 19 called with Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan to congratulate him on his victory in the Romanian presidential election.

Dan, running on a centrist, pro-EU platform, won 53.6% of the vote in a presidential runoff on May 18, defeating his far-right rival, George Simion.

""We respect Romania and the choice of the Romanian people. This is a country on which much depends when it comes to security issues,"" Zelensky said on X.

""We are deeply grateful for Romania’s contribution to protecting the lives of our people. It is important that support for Ukraine continues."" Zelensky said he had invited Dan to Ukraine and discussed the ""nearest opportunities for us to meet.""

Dan's victory is a positive signal for both the EU and Ukraine, as the president-elect has vowed to maintain the country's pro-Western path. The Bucharest mayor, who is set to replace acting President Ilie Bolojan in the Presidential Palace, publicly supported continued aid for Ukraine, presenting it as crucial for Romania's own security.

Ukraine's neighbor and NATO member, Romania, has been a key ally to Kyiv during Russia's full-scale invasion, providing a Patriot air defense missile system and facilitating the transit of Ukrainian grain amid Russian threats to Black Sea shipping.

Simion, leader of the ultranationalist Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), has pledged to oppose further aid for Ukraine if elected and said he would demand repayment for the assistance already provided.

Editor's note: The article was updated with a confirmation from an EU official.

EU countries have agreed in principle to launch a common defense fund of 150 billion euros ($170 billion), an EU official told the Kyiv Independent on May 19.

The decision was previously reported by the Financial Times and Bloomberg.

The move comes as Europe faces an increasingly challenging security environment, with Russia continuing to wage its war against Ukraine and U.S. security commitments to its European partners growing uncertain.

The new mechanism, proposed by the European Commission in March, will allow member states to borrow money from the EU to purchase weapons and military equipment. A formal approval is expected next week, Bloomberg's source said.

Some non-EU countries will reportedly be able to participate in the program if their expenditures do not exceed 35% of the cost.

Despite agreement on the need to hike defense spending, several EU states have disagreed on whether these efforts should be coordinated with nations outside of the bloc, such as the U.K. or Turkey.

The U.K. and the EU concluded a new security pact on May 19, covering areas from maritime security to cyber threats, as London and Brussels seek to reset post-Brexit relations.

The 150-billion-euro fund was proposed as part of the European Commission's ambitious ReArm Europe program, which would also allow member states to spend an additional 650 billion euros ($730 billion) on defense by loosening fiscal rules.

Some of the funds raised under the ReArm Europe program will be allocated to military support to Ukraine, EU Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius said in a media interview in May.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2154602469.jpg

Russia's war against Ukraine is waged not only with missiles and tanks, but with distorted myths — powerful narratives that romanticize empire, rewrite history, and embolden Russian soldiers to reduce once prosperous cities to rubble.

Those very same myths surfaced at the Photo London Festival from May 15 to 18, where the inclusion of Russian photographer and fashion designer Gosha Rubchinskiy's new book ""Victory Day"" sparked fierce backlash.

""The book is a non-partisan representation of post-Soviet military on Red Square,"" Rubchinskiy declared on May 14 in an Instagram post, adding that the photos ""serve as a deeply personal representation of the individual outside of ideology and propaganda.""

Though Rubchinskiy has long insisted that his work transcends politics, critics argue the photographer has been promoting pro-Russian propaganda through art and, in the case of ""Victory Day,"" aestheticizing a war founded on violent falsehoods.

""His work extensively uses Soviet and Russian nationalistic symbols, which is problematic because they are currently used to justify war crimes, torture, and the killing of civilian Ukrainians,"" Emine Ziyatdinova, a Ukrainian photographer of Crimean Tatar descent, told the Kyiv Independent.

""As someone who is part of Russian society, it is nearly impossible (for Rubchinskiy) not to be aware of the semiotic connotations of these symbols and what they represent to the victims of these regimes.""

Ideological military imagery

The black and white portraiture and ""architectural studies"" of Rubchinskiy's ""Victory Day"" were taken from 2018-2019, already half a decade into Russia's ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine.

Rubchinskiy invokes in the photo book's description potent military symbols like Red Square and the World War II memorial in Volgograd — sites that are meant to reinforce the Russian state narrative of the country’s military strength.

""For the last three years of the ongoing full-scale war in Ukraine, multiple Ukrainian cultural figures, curators, politicians, historians, scholars, and artists have tried to show Western cultural institutions that Russian culture is political and aligned with Russian imperialistic ideas.""

In particular, Red Square is the location for Russia's largest Victory Day military parade, where during this year's commemoration, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that Soviet soldiers ""of different ethnic backgrounds… will forever remain Russian soldiers in world history.""

Positioning the Allied Victory against the Nazis during World War II alongside the claim that it is somehow a book dedicated to ""over 20 years of Russian youth culture,"" Rubchinskiy also appears to imply that this Soviet imagery can be claimed by Russians alone, and not the millions of Ukrainians, Belarusians, Kazakhs and other nationalities that fought and died serving in the Soviet army.

""Victory Day"" was presented at the Photo London Festival by the exhibitor A/political, which says on its website that it prides itself on ""producing radical knowledge through cultural terror.""

While Rubchinskiy has long maintained that his work transcends politics, critics argue that he uses art to launder pro-Russian propaganda and that ""Victory Day"" in particular aestheticizes a war rooted in violent falsehoods. (Screenshots / Instagram)

""The presence of Gosha Rubchinskiy's work under the satirical title 'A/Political' at the London Photo Fair is yet another major disappointment and a clear example of the West's ongoing unwillingness to de-romanticize Russian aesthetics, which are rooted in military propaganda and oppression,"" Ukrainian photographer Daria Svertilova told the Kyiv Independent.

""For the last three years of the ongoing full-scale war in Ukraine, multiple Ukrainian cultural figures, curators, politicians, historians, scholars, and artists have tried to show Western cultural institutions that Russian culture is political and aligned with Russian imperialistic ideas. After three years of continuous horrors perpetrated by Russia in Ukraine, one would think these issues should be self-evident — but unfortunately, they are not.""

Although ""Victory Day"" has yet to be widely released, an image displayed on Photo London's website depicts a young military conscript wearing the historic St. George Ribbon.

The black and orange ribbon has been a military decoration since the times of the Russian Empire and was later mainly associated with commemorating Eastern Front veterans of World War II. It has been banned in Ukraine since 2017 after becoming one of the main symbols of Russia’s war of aggression.

The Soviet army played an important role in defeating Nazi Germany, but during that time it was also responsible for a number of massacres, as well as deportations and forced relocations — atrocities that the Soviet government systematically attempted to cover up. Under Putin, Russia has distorted the history of World War II even further by using the accomplishments of the Soviet army as a means to ""justify"" Russia's war against Ukraine, who they depict as Nazis.

""The Russian state and society failed to recognize the war crimes and genocide the Soviet Union committed during World War II,"" Ziyatdinova explained.

""The glorification of these symbols in this exhibition normalizes them together with the past and current war crimes, instead of questioning what the Soviet Union and Russian state have done wrong.""

At the time of this publication, neither the exhibitor A/political nor the Photo London Fair replied to the Kyiv Independent's request for comment.

Justifying annexation

""Victory Day"" is not the first of Rubchinskiy’s projects since 2014 that blur the line between art and pro-Russian propaganda.

His 2014 book ""Crimea/Kids"" is a romanticized portrayal of youth in Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. Promoting the book in the months leading up to Russia's illegal annexation, he was already speaking of the peninsula as Russian.

""All these kids were born in a new country, and because of the internet, they feel the same as other young people in London, China, or Japan. That's why it's interesting for me to see how these young kids born in an informational context manage to keep this kind of Russian spirit, this Russian view on things,"" he told German media outlet 032c in January 2014.

Clothes designed by Gosha Rubchinskiy frequently incorporated the russian flag and the hammer and sickle symbol. (Screenshots / Instagram)

Speaking to British magazine Dazed in September 2014, already several months after the illegal annexation, he called Crimea's youth movement ""a new Russia.""

For natives of the Crimean peninsula like Ziyatdinova, who cannot return home as long as the Russian occupation continues, the depoliticization of the occupation — during which people have been not only forced from their homes but also arbitrarily jailed for opposing it — is especially painful.

It is wrong to publish a book on Crimea ""with an emphasis on the Russian legacy on the peninsula, ignoring the ethnic persecutions, the military force and extensive propaganda used during the occupation,"" Ziyatdinova said.

""This book pretty much lies within the soft Russian propaganda claiming the newly occupied territories (as their own).""

Ideological slipperiness

Despite repeatedly claiming to be above politics, Rubchinskiy has occasionally let slip his belief that Russia suffers from biased media portrayal. In a 2018 article for British media outlet i-D, he lauded the World Cup for spotlighting Russia on the global stage.

""The World Cup is a unique reason to come to Russia and see what's going on here by your own eyes,"" he said. ""Sometimes you should check for yourself and decide your own feelings about things rather than believe other people's opinion from the media.""

Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine also became a launchpad for Rubchinskiy's fashion collection Duval, which he tweeted about on Feb. 25, 2022 — just one day after the war began.

At this point — four years into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and the unlawful annexation of Crimea — Ukrainian political prisoners, including filmmaker and writer Oleh Sentsov, were already suffering harsh conditions in Russian detention, with Sentsov declaring a hunger strike to coincide with the international sporting event to demand the release of all Ukrainians imprisoned by Russia.

Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine also became a launchpad for Rubchinskiy's fashion collection Duval, which he tweeted about on Feb. 25, 2022 — just one day after the full-scale war began.

His one-word tweet, ""Duval,"" framed on the brand's website as ""a statement of rebellion against the war,"" turned a tragedy for millions of Ukrainians into the Russian fashion designer's personal branding.

Such a move is part of the bigger issue which critics see with Rubchinskiy's work — namely, how it exploits post-Soviet trauma, repackaging collective pain as aesthetic currency.

""It is a space where pain, collapse, and violence experienced in the post-Soviet world are transformed into consumable images — rendered as aesthetic or nostalgic resources, easily instrumentalized,"" Ukrainian visual artist Yana Kononov explained in a post on Instagram on May 18.

""(Rubchinskiy's) work functions as a conduit for ideological slipperiness — capable of satisfying both authoritarian desire and Western taste for the 'critically charged'.""

A Ukrainian woman was detained in the northeastern village of Losinka near the Belarusian border on May 19 after she was found transporting five Afghan migrants who had illegally crossed into Poland, the Polish police said.

Poland has frequently accused Belarus and Russia of orchestrating an influx of migrants into the European Union through the Polish border. Warsaw claims thousands are trying to enter Poland from Belarus annually.

According to an official statement, Polish officers stopped a Mazda car for inspection and discovered the 36-year-old Ukrainian woman behind the wheel, along with five Afghan nationals in the vehicle. The migrants were later confirmed to have entered the country unlawfully.

The woman initially claimed she had been visiting a friend in the Hajnowka district and had spontaneously picked up the men while they were hitchhiking. However, she later admitted to the police that she had received instructions via a messaging app to pick up the migrants.

Both the driver and her passengers were handed over to the Polish Border Guard.

Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated Amnesty International as an ""undesirable organization,"" effectively banning the global human rights group from operating in the country, according to a statement released on May 19.

Russia accused the London-based headquarters of Amnesty International of being a hub for what it called ""global Russophobic projects funded by supporters of the Kyiv regime."" Moscow claimed that the group's activities ""aim to intensify the military confrontation in the region.""

The move underscores the Kremlin's intensifying crackdown on civil society and international organizations as it seeks to cement its rule amid the all-out invasion of Ukraine.

Russian prosecutors also alleged that Amnesty International ""supports extremist organizations"" and ""finances the activities of foreign agents.""

The designation under Russia's controversial ""undesirable organizations"" law prohibits groups from operating within Russia and makes it a criminal offense for individuals to participate in their activities. The law has been widely criticized by human rights advocates.

Amnesty International has not yet issued a response.

In April, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law expanding the country's ""foreign agents"" legislation to target individuals who support actions by international organizations or foreign governments deemed hostile to Russia.

First introduced in 2012 and significantly expanded in 2022, Russia's foreign agents law is yet another one of Moscow's primary tools for suppressing criticism.

Lieutenant Colonel Bohdan Shevchuk was dismissed as the commander of the 59th Brigade of the Unmanned Systems Forces and replaced by Colonel Oleksandr Sak, Ukrainska Pravda reported on May 18, citing its sources in the brigade.

The 59th Brigade, deployed in the Pokrovsk sector in Donetsk Oblast, underwent the emergency leadership change between May 15 and 16 on the order of Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, one military source told the news outlet.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

The brigade's new reported commander, Sak, previously led the 53rd Mechanized Brigade fighting in the Kreminna area.

The reasons behind the move have not been disclosed, though Ukrainska Pravda's sources suggested it could be linked to the worsening situation in the Pokrovsk sector.

The mining town has been the epicenter of some of the heaviest battles in Donetsk Oblast as Russian forces have been trying to capture the strategically important settlement for months.

Syrskyi claimed earlier in May that Ukraine has managed to stabilize the situation in the sector and seize the initiative in some areas.

The 59th Brigade, previously named the 59th Motorized Rifle Brigade, came under Syrskyi's scrutiny in July 2024 after Azovstal defender and medic Kateryna Polishchuk, known under the nickname Ptashka (""bird""), called for an investigation into the unit over Shevchuk's alleged misconduct.

The unit was reorganized into an assault brigade under the Unmanned Systems Forces in January 2025, but retained its commander at the time.

Russian President Vladimir Putin will hold a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump on May 19, the Kremlin said, confirming the plan announced by Trump over the weekend.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the conversation between the two leaders is scheduled for 5 p.m. local time and will ""reflect the outcomes of last week’s negotiations in Istanbul"" between Russian and Ukrainian delegations.

The Kremlin's statement comes days after peace talks in Istanbul on May 16 ended with no breakthrough.

Russia once again issued sweeping demands, including Ukraine’s adoption of neutral status, dropping claims for war reparations from Moscow, and the recognition of Russian hold over Crimea and four partially occupied regions.

""If U.S. mediation helps achieve the objectives of (the war) by peaceful means, Russia would prefer that option,"" Peskov said. Moscow has repeatedly declared readiness for peace while rejecting a ceasefire and pushing for maximalist demands.

Editor's note: The article was updated with final election results.

Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski narrowly led Poland’s presidential election on May 18, but failed to secure an outright victory. He will face conservative Karol Nawrocki in a runoff on June 1.

Trzaskowski, a senior figure in Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s Civic Platform (PO) party, won 31.4% of the vote, final results showed. Nawrocki, a historian backed by the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, came in second with 29.5%, setting the stage for a closely contested runoff as no candidate among the 13 contenders passed the 50% threshold.

Speaking to supporters at a rally in Sandomierz, southern Poland, Trzaskowski said: ""We’re going to win,"" but acknowledged that victory would require ""a lot of work and great determination."" He added, ""I’m convinced that all Poland will win.""

Trzaskowski has pledged to work with Tusk’s coalition government to liberalize Poland’s strict abortion laws and to push forward long-stalled judicial reforms, which were previously blocked under the PiS-led government.

Despite leading the polls in the lead-up to the vote, Trzaskowski underperformed expectations, which had placed him 4–6 points ahead of Nawrocki. His campaign now faces the challenge of consolidating centrist and center-left support, including from junior coalition parties such as the Left and the conservative Third Way.

Nawrocki, relatively unknown nationally before being endorsed by the PiS party, has seen his profile rise throughout the campaign. Addressing his supporters in Gdansk, he warned that Tusk must be stopped from gaining ""total power in Poland."" He urged voters who backed far-right candidates Slawomir Mentzen (14.8%) and Grzegorz Braun (6.3%) to rally behind him in the second round to ""save Poland"" from Tusk’s influence.

While Poland’s presidency is largely ceremonial, the role carries veto power. With Tusk’s coalition lacking the parliamentary majority to override a presidential veto, the outcome of the runoff will determine whether the government can move forward with key reforms.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/GettyImages-2215271525.jpg

Finland will supply heavy ammunition to Ukraine using proceeds from frozen Russian assets, the country’s Ministry of Defence said on May 19.

The move is part of a broader European Union initiative to channel profits from immobilized Russian assets into support for Ukraine’s defense. Finland has reached an agreement with the European Commission to implement the measure through the European Peace Facility (EPF), the ministry said in a statement.

Under the agreement, Finland will provide 90 million euros (approximately $100 million) worth of heavy ammunition procured from domestic suppliers. The Finnish government says the deal not only reinforces its support for Ukraine but also benefits its national defense industry.

""We were able to negotiate additional funding for Finland's support for Ukraine. The funds come from frozen Russian assets,"" said Finnish Defense Minister Antti Hakkanen.

""The products are purchased from Finnish industry to boost employment at home and sent to Ukraine to help its defense. I am very pleased with the outcome.""

The Finnish Defense Ministry did not provide details on the timeline, type of ammunition, or delivery logistics due to operational security concerns.

In March, Finland announced its 28th military aid package for Ukraine, valued at approximately 200 million euros (now $225 million).

Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Western countries have frozen approximately $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets, with two-thirds held in the EU.

In October 2024, the Group of Seven (G7) approved nearly $50 billion in loans for Ukraine to be repaid from the proceeds of those frozen funds. The EU has also launched a separate initiative on funneling military aid to Ukraine by similarly using the funds.

Kyiv has consistently urged allies to formalize mechanisms for seizing frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine's defense and reconstruction.

Western governments have primarily relied on reallocating interest income generated by the frozen funds to support Kyiv rather than confiscating the assets outright.

The Kremlin has warned of retaliation if Russian assets are confiscated for Ukraine's benefit. In early 2024, Moscow amended its legislation to allow counter-seizure of Western-owned property in response to asset seizures abroad.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/nammo-16.jpg

Russian authorities have detained nine residents of Stavropol Krai, accusing them of plotting an attack on police officers during May 9 celebrations on behalf of a ""terrorist group,"" the Federal Security Service (FSB) said on May 19.

Eight of the detainees are minors, according to the Russian Investigative Committee.

A teenager from the Andropovsky district was accused of joining an unspecified ""international terrorist organization"" via the Telegram messaging app and recruiting eight other people, including seven teenagers aged between 14 and 16.

The FSB claimed that the detainees planned to attack police officers during the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe, which Russia commemorates on May 9 with opulent military parades.

The French Foreign Ministry on May 18 refuted insinuations by Telegram CEO Pavel Durov that Paris sought to restrict ""conservative voices"" in Romania ahead of a key presidential vote.

Durov, the Russian-born founder of the Telegram messaging app who also holds French and Emirati citizenship, claimed that a ""Western European government"" requested the company to ""silence conservative voices in Romania ahead of today's presidential elections.""

The businessman identified the Western European country only with a baguette emoji, apparently referring to France.

The exchange came shortly before the pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, Nicusor Dan, was elected Romanian president, defeating hard-right Eurosceptic George Simion with a lead of seven percentage points.

""You can’t 'fight election interference' by interfering with elections,"" Durov said on Telegram, claiming he had ""flatly refused"" France's alleged request and did not restrict Romanian users or political channels.

Durov is currently under investigation in France for criminal activity on his messaging app.

""France categorically rejects these allegations and calls on everyone to exercise responsibility and respect for Romanian democracy,"" the French Foreign Ministry reacted on X.

""France calls on all Romanian political actors to exercise responsibility and defend democracy.""

Accusations of election interference have accompanied the Romanian presidential election since November 2024, when the country's Constitutional Court annulled the results and ordered a re-run.

The step came after Romanian intelligence agencies pointed to a massive foreign interference and a campaign on TikTok designed to boost pro-Russian candidate Calin Georgescu. Georgescu, who won the most votes in the first annulled round, was later banned from running again in May amid charges of activities ""against the constitutional order"" and other legal concerns.

Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians, who has been banned from Ukraine, then became the leading right-wing candidate instead of Georgescu.

""In this context, the recent accusations against France are merely a diversionary maneuver from the real threats of interference targeting Romania,"" the French government said.

Various right-wing voices, including senior members of the Trump administration, have criticized the annulment of the original vote and a ban on Georgescu's candidacy, presenting it as an attack on democracy.

Russian forces launched attacks across Ukraine over the past 24 hours, killing at least two civilians and injuring at least 13 others in multiple regions, local officials said on May 19.

Ukrainian air defenses shot down 41 of the 112 Russian attack drones and other drones launched overnight, the Air Force said. Thirty-five drones were neutralized by electronic warfare systems, according to the statement.

The strikes come as Russia continues to reject an unconditional 30-day ceasefire proposed by Kyiv and its allies.

In Kherson Oblast, two people were killed and six injured amid intense shelling, drone strikes, and air strikes on more than 30 towns and villages, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. Residential areas, a factory, a cell tower, and railway infrastructure were among the damaged sites.

In Kharkiv Oblast, three civilians were wounded in the town of Kupiansk during aerial strikes. Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported that over 30 houses and agricultural buildings were damaged in the Kupiansk and Chuhuiv districts, as Russia used glide bombs and 14 Shahed-type drones.

In Donetsk Oblast, Russian attacks injured two civilians, Governor Vadym Filashkin said.

In Sumy Oblast, two civilians were injured, according to the local administration. The region endured 135 Russian strikes targeting 24 settlements, damaging houses, non-residential buildings, and energy infrastructure.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has destroyed a Russian radar system and warehouse facilities located on gas production platforms in the Black Sea using a coordinated drone strike, the agency said on May 19.

According to the SBU, the operation was carried out by the 13th Main Directorate of its Military Counter-Intelligence Department. The mission involved a combination of aerial and naval drones targeting Russian military infrastructure placed on Ukrainian offshore drilling rigs.

An aerial drone allegedly first struck one of the platforms, followed by a naval drone that delivered a secondary hit. The attack destroyed a Russian ""Neva"" radar system used for monitoring aerial and surface activity, as well as supply storage and living quarters on the platform, the SBU reported.

""In a single special operation, our specialists used two types of drones that proved highly effective when working in tandem,"" the agency said.

The SBU noted that the attack is part of an ongoing effort to clear the Black Sea of Russian military presence and equipment. Previous SBU naval drone operations have reportedly targeted the Crimean Bridge and 11 Russian warships.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

The SBU traditionally uses its Sea Baby drones for operations in the Black Sea, while military intelligence (HUR) deploys the Magura naval drones.



In early May, Ukraine shot down two Russian Su-30 fighter jets using air-to-air missiles fired from Magura-7 naval drones and two Russian Mi-8 helicopters in December 2024.

The Magura drones also sank the Russian patrol ship Sergey Kotov on March 5, 2024, and the landing ship Caesar Kunikov on Feb. 14, 2024.

Around 10,000 people rallied in Hungary’s capital on May 18 to protest a controversial bill that critics say would limit free expression and mimic Russia’s restrictive ""foreign agent"" law, the Associated Press reported.

The demonstration in Budapest, one of the largest in recent months, came after a member of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ruling Fidesz party introduced legislation that would grant the government sweeping powers to investigate, penalize, or even ban media outlets and non-governmental organizations receiving any foreign funding.

Protesters packed Kossuth Square outside Hungary's parliament, denouncing the bill as an attack on civil society and democratic freedoms. Speakers at the rally described the legislation as an authoritarian move designed to silence dissent ahead of national elections next year.

""This bill is nothing more than a threat, a threat against people being able to express their opinions clearly and freely,"" said Jakab Toth, one of the speakers. ""If it doesn't belong to all of us, if not all of us are free, then sovereignty is solely and exclusively the sovereignty of the government.""

The proposed law would create a government blacklist of organizations receiving international support and allow intrusive surveillance, large fines, and operational bans. It would be enforced by the Sovereignty Protection Office, a state body established in 2023 that critics say targets independent voices under the guise of national security.

Orban and his allies have accused foreign actors, particularly the United States during previous administrations and Ukraine, of funding independent media and anti-corruption groups to undermine his government. Those organizations deny the claims, saying their work serves the public interest and adheres to professional standards.

Hungary has faced increasing criticism from international watchdogs for eroding press freedom and democratic checks under Orban's 15-year rule. The new legislation, expected to pass in the Fidesz-dominated parliament, is seen by many as the most repressive yet.

In May 2024, a similar foreign agents bill was passed in the Georgian Parliament. The law, backed by the ruling Georgian Dream party, mirrors repressive Russian legislation used to crack down on the Kremlin regime's critics and NGOs in Russia with foreign ties of any kind.

Australian authorities have begun loading the first of the 49 decommissioned Ukraine-bound Abrams tanks onto a cargo ship despite continued private objections from U.S. officials, Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported on May 19.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese confirmed the upcoming delivery of the tanks when meeting President Volodymyr Zelensky in Rome on May 18. The exact date of their arrival is withheld for security reasons, ABC reported.

The Australian broadcaster reported back in April that the shipments of the retired tanks, which are meant to bolster Ukrainian forces as they resist Russian aggression, are delayed in part due to resistance from Washington.

These objections have not fully subsided, with at least one U.S. official questioning their usefulness on the Ukrainian battlefields, according to ABC. An undisclosed Australian defense official told the broadcaster that Canberra is uncertain whether Kyiv is even interested in the vehicles, as their weak roof makes them vulnerable to drones.

U.S. officials have also reportedly pointed to difficulties with their maintenance in the demanding conditions of the Russia-Ukraine war.

Despite the private protests, Washington eventually gave permission for Australia to begin shipping out the U.S.-made tanks to Ukraine, ABC reported.

Australia pledged to send Kyiv the 49 M1A1 Abrams tanks as part of a broader military aid package in October 2024. Ukraine previously received 31 Abrams tanks from the Biden administration in late 2023, though it is unclear how many are still operational as of 2025.

Unlike his predecessor, Joe Biden, U.S. President Donald Trump has been reluctant to allocate additional military aid to Kyiv, aiming instead to broker a peace deal with Russia.

The effectiveness of Abrams tanks on the battlefield in Ukraine has been previously called into question by Western officials.

Trump said he will be speaking, by telephone, to President Vladimir Putin of Russia on May 19 at 10 a.m. Washington time.

According to a Downing Street spokesperson, the leaders discussed Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine and emphasized the urgent need for an unconditional ceasefire, more than three years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion.

On May 10, the U.K., France, Germany, and Italy publicly backed a 30-day ceasefire proposal initiated by Trump and supported by Ukraine.

""Tomorrow, President Putin must show he wants peace by accepting the 30-day unconditional ceasefire proposed by President Trump and backed by Ukraine and Europe,"" French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on X following Sunday’s call.

Pro-EU candidate Nicusor Dan won the Romanian presidential election on May 18, defeating the far-right, anti-Ukraine George Simion.

Dan won Sunday's runoff with 53.6% of the votes, while Simion earned 46.4%, according to Romania's election authority.

President Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated Dan on his victory: ""For Ukraine—as a neighbor and friend—it is important to have a reliable partner in Romania. And we are confident that this will indeed be the case. By working together, we can strengthen both our countries and our shared Europe.""

The result comes as a relief for Ukraine, who faced the loss of a key ally in the event of a Simion victory. Simion, leader of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), championed a Euroskeptic platform that included ending military aid for Ukraine.

""Ukraine needs us, we don't need Ukraine,"" Simion said during a televised debate on May 8. Simion is banned from entering both Ukraine and neighboring Molodova due to his anti-Ukrainian stance.

Dan, an independent centrist and the current mayor of Bucharest, supports aid to Ukraine, calling it ""essential for the security of Romania.""

Despite exit polls clearly predicting a victory for Dan, Simion declared himself the president of Romania in a post on social media.

Polls showed the two candidates neck-and-neck in the days leading up to the runoff election, with an AtlasIntel survey on May 13 placing both at 48.2%.

The current election follows the annulment of the first round in November 2024, which Romania's Constitutional Court invalidated due to evidence of foreign interference.

That round was won by populist Calin Georgescu, who openly promoted conspiracy theories and supported Russia, calling Ukraine a ""fictional state"" and predicting its partition as ""inevitable.""

Romania then held first-round elections on May 4, which Simion won with nearly 41% of the votes. His victory triggered the resignation of Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu.

Romania has provided Ukraine with crucial defense and humanitarian suppor throughout Russia's full-scale war.

""We have now agreed that we will talk again — the four heads of state and government and the American president in preparation for this conversation,"" Merz said.

""We can only hope that now there will be further progress (towards a ceasefire).""

Merz said that he has already discussed the upcoming Trump-Putin call with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

The European leaders' conversation with Trump will come a week after Merz, Macron, Starmer and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk spoke with the U.S. president about their demand that Russia accept an unconditional 30-day ceasefire beginning May 12. Trump indicated support for the proposal and agreed Washington would impose sanctions on Russia if they did not agree.

When Putin countered with an invitation to direct peace talks in Istanbul on May 15, however, Trump quickly urged Ukraine to accept. He said a ceasefire could potentially be negotiated in Turkey and said he might also join the talks.

Trump did not attend the Istanbul peace talks — nor did Putin, who instead sent a delegation of lower-level aides even after President Volodymyr Zelensky invited him to meet face-to-face at the negotiating table.

The talks failed to produce a ceasefire agreement.

Kyiv Oblast Governor Mykola Kalashnyk reported that the attack killed one person and injured three others. Actual casualties from the attack are still being clarified, he said.

Kyiv Independent journalists in the capital heard multiple explosions throughout the night as air defenses worked in the city.

The Air Force said it intercepted 88 drones, while 128 others vanished from radars, likely used as decoys to overwhelm air defenses. The air defense involved the coordinated use of electronic warfare units, mobile fire teams, and anti-aircraft systems.

The previous largest drone attack of the full-scale invasion occurred on Feb. 23, when 267 drones entered Ukrainian airspace, Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said at the time.

Despite increasing international pressure for an unconditional ceasefire, Moscow has intensified its assaults, displaying ongoing resistance to and disdain for diplomatic efforts.

Trump to talk to Putin on May 19 in push to end Ukraine war 'bloodbath'

U.S. President Donald Trump said he will be speaking, by telephone, to President Vladimir Putin of Russia on May 19, at 10 a.m.

Trump's comments come as peace talks in Istanbul on May 16 ended with no breakthrough, and Russia once again issued sweeping demands, including Ukraine’s adoption of neutral status, dropping claims for war reparations from Moscow and the recognition of its loss of Crimea and four occupied regions — none of which Russia fully controls.

""The subjects of the call will be stopping the 'bloodbath' that is killing, on average, more than 5,000 Russian and Ukrainian soldiers a week, and trade,"" he wrote on Truth Social.

""I will then be speaking to President Zelensky of Ukraine and then, with President Zelensky, various members of NATO,"" he added. ""Hopefully it will be a productive day, a ceasefire will take place, and this very violent war — a war that should have never happened — will end. God bless us all!!!""

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed to Russia's state-owned TASS news agency on May 17 that the preparations for the call are underway.

Following his Middle East trip, Trump told Fox News' Bret Baier in an interview published on May 16 that he believes Putin is ready to strike a deal to end the war in Ukraine, but warned that if negotiations fail, his administration will move forward with sanctions against Moscow.

""Honestly, I will (impose sanctions), if we're not gonna make a deal,"" Trump said. ""This is turkey time, we’re talking turkey, and we’ll see what happens. This would be crushing for Russia because they're having a hard time now with the economy, oil prices are low.""

Trump said he believes a deal won't be possible without his involvement and expressed plans to meet with Putin soon, adding: ""I have a very good relationship with Putin.""

Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held a phone call on May 17, reportedly initiated by the U.S., to discuss bilateral relations and recent peace talks in Istanbul, Russian state media said.

Lavrov welcomed what he called Washington's ""constructive"" role in encouraging Kyiv to accept Putin's proposal to resume talks. Rubio reportedly praised the 1,000-for-1,000 POW exchange and ongoing efforts to define ceasefire terms.

Russia plans 'training' launch of Yars intercontinental ballistic missile overnight on May 19, Ukraine's HUR claims

Russia is planning a ""training"" launch of an RS-24 intercontinental ballistic missile overnight on May 19, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) reported on May 18.

According to the agency, the missile will be equipped with a ""training"" warhead, and the move is intended to intimidate Ukraine, as well as EU and NATO member states.

The launch is set to take place near the village of Svobodny in Sverdlovsk Oblast, roughly 100 kilometers northeast of Yekaterinburg, according to HUR.

The agency did not specify what the potential target of a possible attack might be.

Yars, or RS-24, is a strategic solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile system adopted by Russia in 2009. It has a claimed range of 11,000 kilometers and, when equipped with a combat warhead, an explosive power equivalent to a million tons of trinitrotoluene (TNT).

The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims.

The possible launch echoes Russia's use of an Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) in an attack on Dnipro on Nov. 21, 2024, which followed the lifting of U.S. and U.K. restrictions on long-range Ukrainian strikes inside Russia.

That strike was also followed by a Russian media campaign aimed at eroding Western support for Ukraine.

New clips from Putin documentary suggest Russia dismissed Ukraine peace talks, ceasefire weeks ago

Vladimir Putin said on March 27 that Moscow has ""enough forces and means"" to bring its war against Ukraine to a ""logical conclusion"" without making any meaningful concessions, it has been revealed in new clips from a documentary released on May 18.

""Russia has enough forces and means to bring what we started in 2022 to a logical conclusion with the result Russia needs,"" Putin said while recording the film ""Russia. Kremlin. Putin. 25 Years.""

""This result is the elimination of the causes that led to this crisis, the creation of conditions for long-term sustainable peace, and the security of the Russian state.""

The documentary aired on May 4 but made only passing references to the U.S.-led peace process ongoing at the time of the interview.

The latest comments — publicly withheld until now and posted on Telegram by the interviewer — come nearly four months into U.S. President Donald Trump's push for a ceasefire which has been repeatedly rejected by Russia.

A source in the Ukrainian President's Office told the Kyiv Independent that Russia's delegation in Istanbul on May 16 reiterated demands for Ukraine to retreat from all annexed territories.

In the new comments, Putin said a priority is securing Russian-speaking populations in territories Russia claims as its own — a reference to Crimea and the partially occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts.

The Kremlin declared its annexation of the four regions in 2022 after sham referenda, despite not fully controlling any of them.

Moscow also insisted Ukraine abandon NATO ambitions, forgo reparations, and accept a neutral status with no foreign military support — demands Kyiv has categorically rejected.

Despite initiating the Istanbul talks, the Kremlin dispatched only mid-level officials. Zelensky had called on Putin to attend personally, stressing that only the Russian president could authorize a ceasefire.

Kyiv and European governments continue to push for an unconditional truce, which Ukraine accepted in March. Moscow has ignored the offer and intensified its strikes on Ukrainian cities.

Ukraine's 47th Brigade battalion commander resigns, slams military leadership over 'stupid objectives'

Oleksandr Shyrshyn, battalion commander of the 47 Separate Mechanized Brigade, has submitted his resignation, sharply criticizing Ukraine's military leadership for what he described as senseless orders and unnecessary casualties.

""I have never received more stupid objectives than in the current direction,"" Shyrshyn wrote in a blunt Facebook post announcing his decision on May 16. ""Someday I will tell you the details, but the stupid loss of people, trembling in front of a stupid generals, leads to nothing but failures.""

""I hope your children will also serve in the infantry and carry out your orders,"" he added.

Ukraine's General Staff initiated an internal investigation on May 18 in response to Shyrshyn's accusations.

The Kyiv Independent reported in 2023 that the brigade, which was formed from scratch in 2022 and is often known by the name ""Magura,"" was prepared with the summer 2023 counteroffensive in mind; its soldiers were trained in NATO countries and equipped with superior new Western equipment.

In 2024, the brigade was engaged in combat operations within Russia's Kursk Oblast.

Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first major foreign ground offensive into Russian territory since World War II. The operation sought to delay a planned Russian push into Ukraine's Sumy Oblast and redirect Russian forces away from eastern Donetsk Oblast.

Moscow began a major counteroffensive in early March, retaking large portions of territory including the town of Sudzha. Ukrainian forces have since withdrawn from much of the area but still maintain limited control in some zones as of late April despite Russia's claims that its forces have fully recaptured the territory of the region.

Meanwhile, Shyrshyn on May 16 accused the military command of focusing on punishments rather than results. ""All they are capable of is reprimands, investigations, imposition of penalties. Everyone is going to hell,"" he wrote. ""Political games and assessment of the real state of affairs do not correspond to either reality or possibilities. They played games.""

Shyrshyn said he has filed a formal report requesting dismissal from his post and expressed hope that it would be accepted soon.

President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican on May 18, following the pontiff's inauguration mass, he said in a post on social media.

""For millions of people around the world, the Pontiff is a symbol of hope for peace. The authority and voice of the Holy See can play an important role in bringing this war to an end,"" Zelensky said.

""We appreciate the support for Ukraine and the clear voice in defense of a just and lasting peace,"" he added.

The visit marked Zelensky's first in-person meeting with the new pope, formerly Cardinal Robert Prevost, who was elected head of the Catholic Church on May 8.

During their meeting, Zelensky presented Pope Leo with a special icon, ""Mother of God with Child,"" painted on a fragment of a box that held heavy artillery. The icon was brought from Izium, a Kharkiv Oblast town located about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the front line. A pregnant woman was killed in a Russian missile attack against Izium in February of this year.

The gift represents children ""who suffered from the war, who were deliberately kidnapped and deported by Russia and who are very much awaited at home in Ukraine,"" Zelensky said.

The return of Ukraine's forcibly deported children was among the issues Zelensky and Pope Leo discussed during their first phone call on May 12.

During the inauguration mass, Zelensky was accompanied by First Lady Olena Zelenska and Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak.

The event drew 250,000 pilgrims and 156 foreign delegations, including U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who met Pope Francis shortly before his death.

A day before the event, Rubio said that the Vatican could serve as a neutral venue for future peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow.

Speaking in Rome before his meeting with Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, the Vatican's envoy on Ukraine, Rubio noted that ""both sides would be comfortable"" holding talks there.

On May 11, during his first public address, the pope said he carried the ""suffering of the beloved people of Ukraine"" in his heart and called for an ""authentic and lasting peace.""

Zelensky had his first phone call with Pope Leo XIV on May 12, describing the conversation as ""warm"" and ""substantive."" On May 18, the pontiff received a list of Ukrainian prisoners of war held by Russia.

Before becoming pope, Leo XIV denounced Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine while serving as Bishop of Chiclayo in Peru. In a 2022 interview, he described it as ""a true invasion, imperialist in nature, where Russia seeks to conquer territory for reasons of power.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/pope.jpg

The Russian Federation on May 18 detained an oil tanker sailing from the Estonian port of Sillamae, Estonia's Foreign Ministry reported.

The incident comes three days after Russia reportedly violated NATO airspace with a fighter when Estonia attempted to intercept a suspected ""shadow fleet"" vessel in the Baltic Sea.

The oil tanker Green Admire was a Greek-owned vessel sailing under a Liberian flag, the Estonian Foreign Ministry said. It departed from Estonia following a previously agreed-upon route via Russian territorial waters.

The route was ""selected for its maritime safety and not aligned strictly along national boundaries"" and ""established through mutual agreement between Russia, Estonia, and Finland,"" the ministry said in a statement.

As a precaution, Estonia plans to redirect traffic to and from the Sillamae port exclusively through its own territorial waters. The ministry has also informed NATO allies of the incident.

""Today's incident shows that Russia continues to behave unpredictably,"" Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said.

Baltic nations have sounded the alarm about Russia's increasing aggression in the Baltic Sea, including suspected acts of sabotage.

Earlier this month, Latvia's Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIDD) reported that Russian military behavior in the Baltic Sea region is ""increasing the threat of accidental military incidents.""

The report cited Russia's aggressive tactics, such as unauthorized airspace incursions and close encounters with NATO ships and aircraft.

A Russian military jet on May 15 violated NATO airspace after the Estonian Navy tried to stop the Jaguar, a tanker believed to belong to Moscow's shadow fleet. Russia's ""shadow fleet"" of oil vessels consists of aging tankers used to circumvent sanctions, including those imposed by the EU, U.K., and U.S.

U.S. President Donald Trump is becoming more impatient with Russia as he attempts to negotiate a ceasefire in the war against Ukraine, Finnish President Alexander Stubb said at a press conference on May 18, according to the Finnish news outlet Ilta-Sanomat.

Stubb's remarks come after he held talks with Trump on May 17 and a separate conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky on May 18.

""If you put it together, you could say that Zelensky is patient and President Trump is getting impatient, but in the right direction, which is towards Russia,"" Stubb told reporters on the sidelines of the Lennart Meri defense conference in Tallinn, Estonia.

Progress towards a ceasefire has been moving ""slowly but surely"" in a better direction for Ukraine, Stubb said.

The Finnish leader's comments come a day before Trump is set to hold a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 19. Following his talk with Putin, Trump plans to speak with Zelensky and ""various members of NATO.""

Trump has said he hopes the talks will result in a ceasefire agreement.

The planned calls follow failed peace talks in Istanbul, which Putin proposed as an alternative to accepting Ukraine and Europe's demand for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. Zelensky agreed to meet Putin in Turkey, but Putin instead sent a delegation of lower-level aides to represent Russia.

The talks, which represented the first direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia since the early days of the full-scale invasion in 2022, failed to result in a ceasefire. Moscow repeated its maximalist demands, including sweeping territorial concessions and neutral status for Ukraine, while hurling insults at Ukrainian leadership.

The countries did agree to to a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange, which Ukraine's military intelligence says may take place next week. The swap will mark the largest such exchange throughout the war.

Stubb said that the prisoner exchange was a positive sign and that he urged Trump to hold a summit with both Zelensky and Putin. He did not have any details to share regarding the upcoming call between Putin and Trump.

""After (the call) we will be a degree wiser. We'll go a little bit day by day,"" he said.

European leaders want to show Trump that Ukraine's position is relatively strong and Russia has serious weaknesses, Stubb said.

""So there has been a lot of talk that Ukraine is strongly at a loss. The answer is that it is not,"" he said.

""Russia has been trying to invade Ukraine for three years. This year they have advanced less than a percentage point of Ukrainian land.""

Russia's economy is also weaker than it may seem, he said.

Trump has several times threatened to impose new sanctions against Russia if it does not agree to a ceasefire, but has not yet followed through on any of those threats despite the Kremlin's continued stalling. The Trump administration has instead consistently put pressure on Ukraine to make concessions towards a peace deal.

Europe is ""far from"" discussing foreign troop deployment to Ukraine, as efforts focus on securing an unconditional ceasefire, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on May 17, Reuters reported.

""There is no reason to talk about (troops) at the moment, we are far from that. We want the weapons to stop, the killing to end,"" Merz said during a joint press conference with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.

His comments come amid growing interest in a potential multinational force to monitor a future peace agreement in Ukraine, even as Russian strikes continue.

A so-called ""coalition of the willing"" led by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron has pushed the idea, emphasizing that a ""reassurance force"" would monitor an eventual ceasefire, not engage in combat with Russia.

Merz stressed that the next diplomatic step is to establish a viable framework for peace negotiations and determine potential security guarantees for Ukraine once a truce is in place.

The statement comes after peace talks held in Istanbul on May 16, which were the first direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine since 2022.

The Russian delegation — composed of lower-level aides — reiterated maximalist demands including Ukraine's neutrality, withdrawal from all annexed regions, and an end to foreign military aid.

President Volodymyr Zelensky, who had invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to participate in direct talks, condemned the absence of top Russian leadership as a signal Moscow is not serious about ending the war.

Ukraine accepted a U.S.-proposed unconditional 30-day ceasefire in March. Russia rejected it and continued its attacks, including a record-setting drone attack on May 18.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov earlier rejected the idea of deploying European peacekeepers in Ukraine.

""We cannot allow NATO's military infrastructure to get that close to our borders,"" Peskov told ABC News on May 11.

While U.S. President Donald Trump has ruled out sending American troops, U.S. officials have indicated Washington could support the coalition with intelligence-sharing and logistics.

President Volodymyr Zelensky met with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on May 18, following the inaugural mass of Pope Leo XIV, where the leaders discussed sanctions on Russia and recent peace talks in Istanbul.

The meeting marked the first public encounter between Zelensky and Vance since their heated Oval Office exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 28.

""During our talks we discussed negotiations in Istanbul to where the Russians sent a low level delegation of non-decision-makers,"" Zelensky wrote on X.

""I reaffirmed that Ukraine is ready to be engaged in real diplomacy and underscored the importance of a full and unconditional ceasefire as soon as possible.""

""We have also touched upon the need for sanctions against Russia, bilateral trade, defense cooperation, battlefield situation and upcoming prisoners exchange,"" Zelensky added.

The meeting also occurred one day before a scheduled call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin and followed negotiations in Istanbul on May 16, where Russia sent only low-level delegates, raising doubts about Moscow's commitment to ending the war.

""Pressure is needed against Russia until they are eager to stop the war,"" Zelensky said.

In one positive development, Russia and Ukraine reached an agreement on May 16 for the exchange of prisoners of war (POWs) on a 1,000-for-1,000 basis, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, who was leading Ukraine's delegation, told reporters.

Trump, who has not imposed new sanctions on Russia to pressure it into establishing a ceasefire, plans to speak with Putin on May 19, followed by calls with Zelensky and NATO leaders. He said the talks are intended to end the ""bloodbath"" and achieve a ceasefire.

Ukraine accepted a U.S.-proposed 30-day unconditional ceasefire in March. Moscow has continued its large-scale drone and missile strikes, including the largest drone attack of the war on May 18, when 273 drones entered Ukrainian airspace.

In Washington, Republican lawmakers have echoed the call for punitive actions against Moscow. U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg told Fox Business that the ""Russian Sanctions Act of 2025 is ready to go.""

Ukraine's General Staff initiated an internal investigation on May 18 following the resignation of Oleksandr Shyrshyn, commander of the 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade, who criticized military leadership for what he described as senseless orders and unnecessary casualties.

""By order of the chief of the General Staff, a working group has been set up for a comprehensive study of the circumstances outlined (by Shyrshyn),"" the General Staff wrote in a statement.

It pledged to analyze orders issued at multiple levels of the command hierarchy for their relevance to the battlefield situation and make ""appropriate decisions"" following the inspection.

Shyrshyn's resignation, posted to Facebook on May 16, was unusually direct.

""I have never received more stupid objectives than in the current direction,"" he wrote. ""The stupid loss of people, trembling in front of stupid generals, leads to nothing but failures.""

Shyrshyn added, ""I hope your children will also serve in the infantry and carry out your orders.""

In 2024, the brigade participated in Ukraine's cross-border incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast — the first Ukrainian ground operation into Russian territory since World War II.

Editor's note: This story is based on the Kyiv Independent's investigative documentary, ""Curated Theft"" – watch it in English here, for free.

As Ukraine's liberating forces advanced in the fall of 2022, several trucks stopped near the rear yard of the Kherson Local History Museum. Inside the building itself, dozens of people moved back and forth like ants through the corridors.

These people didn't work there — they were employees from museums in occupied Crimea who, on the instructions of the Russian leadership, had come to remove Scythian and Sarmatian gold jewellery, valuable collections of weapons and coins, and thousands of other historical artifacts from then-occupied Kherson.

""Some of them did the packing, others grabbed what they liked,"" a museum guard recalled in an interview with the Kyiv independent.

They then shifted their focus to the nearby Kherson Museum of Local Lore. What was unfolding was just part of what would amount to the looting of nearly 33,000 items from the two museums — the largest such theft in Europe since World War II.

A two-year investigation by Ukrainian authorities has made little progress. The media has only mentioned the names of Ukrainian defectors who collaborated with Russia.

The Kyiv Independent has discovered not only who organized the illegal removal of valuables, but also where the collections are now held.

To dupe those responsible into revealing previously secret details of the theft, investigative journalist Yevheniia Motorevska would have to take on the roles of a naive producer of a Russian TV channel, and a tough and inquisitive investigator of the Russian Federation.

'It was a real act of vandalism'

Both museums are located in the central part of Kherson near the Dnipro River, an area which before Russia's full-scale invasion, was always crowded with people visiting the exhibitions and frequenting the local restaurants.

The city of Kherson was occupied by Russian forces in the early days of March, 2022, until being liberated by Ukraine's lightning counteroffensive later that year.

Today this area is a red zone which suffers constant shelling — just a couple of kilometers away, on the other bank of the Dnipro river, Russian forces fire artillery, and launch drones that systematically target civilians in what has been dubbed a ""human safari.""

Since the end of the 19th century, the Kherson Local History Museum had accumulated more than 180,000 artifacts including those of the Scythians, Sarmatians, Goths, Greeks and Romans, all of whom lived in the territory of modern southern Ukraine over the centuries.

Today all that remains are the paper descriptions where they used to be displayed.

""In Russia, they always spoke of themselves as a cultural nation. But no, only vandals could have done that.""

The current head of the Kherson Local History museum, Olha Honcharova, told the Kyiv Independent about the moment she first entered the museum after the city’s liberation.

""It was a real act of vandalism. In Russia, they always spoke of themselves as a cultural nation. But no, only vandals could have done that,"" she said.

""A very expensive item that was in this hall was the saber of the Emir of Bukhara. It cost, according to some estimates, more than $150,000,"" she added while walking around the empty halls.

Honcharova was appointed to her position immediately after Kherson was liberated from Russian occupation. Her predecessor, Tetiana Bratchenko, collaborated with the occupation regime and is now, according to the Kyiv Independent's investigation, hiding in Russia.

In total, more than 23,000 exhibits were stolen from the Kherson Museum of Local Lore, as well as all the records of the collection.

Witnesses to the theft were two of the museum's guards who continued to work when the city was occupied, but refused to cooperate with Russian forces.

They claim that during the looting, some 70 specialists from occupied Crimea selected exhibits, kept records, and packed items in the museum. None gave their names or positions.

The guards also pointed to a mysterious commandant who personally supervised the removal of valuables — but the details they provided were not sufficient on their own to identify him.

'I personally carried the exhibits out'

Before Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukrainian Artem Lagoysky was a Kherson blogger known as ""Bydlo."" When the Russians arrived, he eagerly accepted a post in the occupying regime as deputy minister of culture.

The Kyiv Independent knew he had information about the theft but in order to speak to him and get him to open up, had to pose as Russian journalists making a film about culture in the ""territories liberated by Russia.""

Believing he was speaking to a ""TV producer in Moscow,"" Lagoysky, speaking from the occupied Ukrainian city of Henichesk, Kherson Oblast, freely admitted that he ""personally carried the exhibits from museums during the evacuation.""

Lagoysky also revealed the names of other high-ranking officials from occupied Crimea who came to remove artifacts — Elena Morozova, director of the Chersonesos Museum, which is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, and Mikhail Smorodkin, director of the Sevastopol Defense Museum, one of the largest museums on the occupied peninsula.

Both are Russian citizens who moved to Crimea to take up positions there after the peninsula was occupied in 2014.

""They came in groups, with guys. Everyone helped us,"" Lagosky added.

To obtain more evidence of their involvement in the museum theft, it was necessary to contact another defector, Oleksandr Kuzmenko, who at the time of the looting was the ""minister of culture"" in Kherson Oblast. Before the full-scale invasion, he was the director of a local music school.

Kuzmenko no longer holds a minister position and was unlikely to want to speak to Russian journalists, so a different approach was needed — Motorevska called him under the guise of an ""investigator from Moscow"" looking into how several objects that were supposed to be taken to Russian-controlled territories had appeared on the black market.

During the conversation, Kuzmenko confirmed that both Morozova and Smorodkin were present in Kherson, claiming it was they who decided which exhibits should be taken out of the Local History Museum and which should stay.

""They are experts. They know what is valuable and what is not,"" Kuzmenko said.

Using the same cover story, Motorevska called another Kherson defector, Andriy Khodchenko, the Local History Museum’s former deputy director, who, after the liberation of Kherson fled to Russia's Krasnodar Krai, a region that shares a border with Ukraine.

Khodchenko also fell for the ruse and confirmed Morozova's presence, also sharing details about another Crimean official, Mikhail Smorodkin, the Sevastopol Defense Museum’s director, claiming at one point he tried to put some of the museum's exhibits into his own car.

""But I pointed it out to the commandant, and the commandant made him move the items into the truck. He said: 'Everything will be loaded here. I will seal everything',"" Khodchenko said.

This was confirmation that directors of two museums — the Chersonesos Museum and Sevastopol Defense Museum — were present during the theft. These are also the two museums it was suspected the looted items were taken to.

Now it was time to establish the name of the Russian officer, the commandant of Kherson, who personally participated in, and possibly oversaw, the theft.

""As I remember, the commandant was limping, he walked with a cane... I don't know his last name, but I saw him during the evacuation,"" Kuzmenko said.

The mysterious commandant

There were clues to his identity — the museum guards said he was wearing the uniform of a colonel, and it was already known he walked with a limp.

Lagoysky said in addition to looting the museums, he and the commandant personally took the remains of Russian military leader Grigory Potemkin from his tomb in St. Catherine's Cathedral in Kherson.

This was even documented — Lagoysky sent photographs of the process to journalists, but the angle of the commandant in the picture prevented identification

According to Lagoysky, he and the commandant personally carried out the exhumation during the occupation. (Artem Lagoysky's personal archive)

Fortunately, Kuzmenko had another photograph which clearly showed the commandant's face, which he sent to the Kyiv Independent via Telegram.

(Artem Lagoysky’s personal archive)

With the help of facial recognition software, he was swiftly identified — Dmitry Lipov, a Russian naval officer with the rank equivalent to a colonel.

It is known from open sources that he is the head of the communications center of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, but his senior position among the occupation authorities of Kherson has not been previously reported.

Dmitry Lipov, a Russian naval officer with the rank equivalent to a colonel.

The Russian defectors interviewed by the Kyiv Independent also said Lipov coordinated his actions with the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) — in fact, it was representatives of the FSB who oversaw the entire operation.

Khodchenko reported that FSB officers held meetings in Kherson with museum employees and occupation authorities in Kherson Oblast, and helped organize the theft.

The Kyiv Independent team discovered the FSB officer who led this process was called Vasily, but could not fully identify him.

Destruction of Ukrainian identity

According to Kuzmenko, FSB officers also supervised the removal of valuables from the Art Museum where more than 10,000 works of art, including three paintings by the famous Ukrainian painter Ivan Aivazovsky, were looted.

""(The Russians) were mainly focused on taking paintings, they took those away. They left artworks that were not in very good condition, or that they simply didn’t like,"" the current deputy director Ihor Rusol said.

In 2022, the Russians stole almost 35,000 artifacts — the same number of items in the exhibition halls of the Louvre in Paris, France.

At least part of the Art Museum's collection is now located in occupied Crimea, at the Taurida Central Museum.

In total, according to the information of the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine, from six museums in the territories liberated by the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2022, the Russians stole almost 35,000 artifacts — the same number of items in the exhibition halls of the Louvre in Paris, France.

The illegal removal of valuables also occurred in the territories that remain under occupation — Ukrainian authorities reported the looting of the Melitopol Local History Museum in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, and the Mariupol Local History Museum in Donetsk Oblast.

The scale of the thefts from these museums is impossible to accurately assess at present.

A Russian plan to cover up the theft

Vitalii Tytych is a lawyer and military serviceman. In the first two years of the full-scale war, he documented crimes against cultural heritage as part of a special Territorial Defence Forces unit.

Tytych believes the Russians will, ironically, try to use international law to get away with the thefts, citing the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict to try to convince the world they were not looting, but saving artifacts from possible damage caused by being near the front lines.

""Persecution of museum workers, theft of the records without leaving descriptions or documenting the selection process — it had nothing to do with the actions stipulated by the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property,” Tytych said.

The Local History Museum’s staff together with public initiatives are working to restore the records of the collection stolen by the Russians. Due to the fact Ukraine does not have a unified state register of museum values, this process is complex.

However, the relevant documentation is the basis for establishing the extent of the damage caused to Ukraine and for making claims in the future.

Vitalii Tytych sees the looting of museums as part of Russia's state policy to destroy Ukrainian culture, which has been ongoing since tsarist times.

""The idea of ​​destroying the Ukrainian nation through the destruction of the features of its identity, its distinction from all other 'Russian world' is at the heart of this aggression,"" Tytych said.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1245781851.jpg

Russia is planning a ""training"" launch of an RS-24 intercontinental ballistic missile overnight on May 19, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) reported on May 18.

According to the agency, the missile will be equipped with a ""training"" warhead, and the move is intended to intimidate Ukraine, as well as EU and NATO member states.

The possible launch of the nuclear-capable missile follows peace talks in Istanbul on May 16 and comes just hours before a scheduled phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump.

The launch is set to take place near the village of Svobodny in Sverdlovsk Oblast, roughly 100 kilometers northeast of Yekaterinburg, according to HUR.

The agency did not specify what the potential target of a possible attack might be.

Yars, or RS-24, is a strategic solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile system adopted by Russia in 2009. It has a claimed range of 11,000 kilometers and, when equipped with a combat warhead, an explosive power equivalent to a million tons of trinitrotoluene (TNT).

The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims.

The possible launch echoes Russia's use of an Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) in an attack on Dnipro on Nov. 21, 2024, which followed the lifting of U.S. and U.K. restrictions on long-range Ukrainian strikes inside Russia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on March 27 that Moscow has ""enough forces and means"" to bring its war against Ukraine to a ""logical conclusion"" without making any meaningful concessions, it has been revealed in new clips from a documentary released on May 18.

""Russia has enough forces and means to bring what we started in 2022 to a logical conclusion with the result Russia needs,"" Putin said while recording the film ""Russia. Kremlin. Putin. 25 Years.""

""This result is the elimination of the causes that led to this crisis, the creation of conditions for long-term sustainable peace, and the security of the Russian state.""

The documentary aired on May 4 but made only passing references to the U.S.-led peace process ongoing at the time of the interview.

The latest comments — publicly withheld until now and posted on Telegram by the interviewer — come nearly four months into U.S. President Donald Trump's push for a ceasefire which has been repeatedly rejected by Russia, and two days after the first direct talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations since 2022, in which Moscow reiterated its maximalist demands.

A source in the Ukrainian President's Office told the Kyiv Independent that Russia's delegation in Istanbul on May 16 reiterated demands for Ukraine to retreat from all annexed territories.

The development comes ahead of a scheduled May 19 phone call between Putin and Trump, who continues to attempt to broker a ceasefire.

In the new comments, Putin said a priority is securing Russian-speaking populations in territories Russia claims as its own — a reference to Crimea and the partially occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts.

The Kremlin declared its annexation of the four regions in 2022 after sham referenda, despite not fully controlling any of them.

Moscow also insisted Ukraine abandon NATO ambitions, forgo reparations, and accept a neutral status with no foreign military support — demands Kyiv has categorically rejected.

Despite initiating the Istanbul talks, the Kremlin dispatched only mid-level officials. President Volodymyr Zelensky had called on Putin to attend personally, stressing that only the Russian president could authorize a ceasefire.

Trump, who has not imposed new sanctions on Russia to pressure it into establishing a ceasefire, plans to speak with Putin on May 19. He said he would then speak with Zelensky and NATO leaders.

Editor's note: This article has been updated to include information from Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR).

Poland and Romania — key NATO allies bordering Ukraine — are holding presidential elections on May 18, with both votes unfolding under the shadow of Russian interference and rising far-right influence.

The simultaneous elections are being closely watched across Europe, with growing concerns about foreign meddling and a potential shift in regional policy toward Ukraine as nationalist and pro-Russian voices gain traction.

In Romania, far-right, Eurosceptic candidate George Simion faces pro-EU Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan in a tight runoff.

Simion, the leader of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), secured nearly 40% of the vote in the first round on May 4 and has called for Ukraine to compensate Romania for its aid contributions.

""Ukraine needs us, we don't need Ukraine,"" Simion said during a televised debate on May 8. ""We certainly want compensation for Romania's participation in the war effort so far.""

Simion's platform includes ending military aid for Ukraine, prioritizing national interests, and renegotiating the country's foreign commitments. If elected, his presidency could realign Romania's foreign policy at a critical moment in Russia's war against Ukraine.

Polls show the two candidates neck-and-neck, with an AtlasIntel survey on May 13 placing both at 48.2%. Voting in Romania began at 7 a.m. and will continue until 9 p.m. Romanians abroad were able to cast ballots since May 16.

Romania has played a vital role in Ukraine's defense and humanitarian response, donating a U.S.-made Patriot missile system in 2024, signing a bilateral security agreement with Kyiv, and facilitating grain exports through the Black Sea.

The current election follows the annulment of the initial first round in November 2024, which Romania's Constitutional Court invalidated over evidence of social media manipulation and foreign interference.

That round had been won by populist Calin Georgescu, who openly promoted conspiracy theories and supported Russia, calling Ukraine a ""fictional state"" and predicting its partition as ""inevitable.""

Warsaw accuses Russia of interference as Poles head to the polls

Meanwhile, in Poland, Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned on May 16 that Russian hackers attacked websites of ruling coalition parties just days before the presidential vote.

""Two days before the elections, a group of Russian hackers operating on Telegram attacked the websites of Civic Platform,"" Tusk wrote on X. He said the cyberattacks also targeted the Left and Polish People's Party (PSL), both members of his coalition.

Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) reported on May 18 that Moscow has intensified a disinformation campaign targeting NATO and EU countries, with Poland as a central focus.

According to HUR, the operation — codenamed ""Doppelganger"" — uses fake media websites mimicking trusted Western outlets to publish Kremlin propaganda disguised as credible analysis.

Since March 2025, Russian intelligence services have reportedly been spreading false and manipulative messages targeting Polish voters, including on the social media platform X.

These efforts have been amplified by bot farms and artificial accounts impersonating real users, according to HUR.

Poland's Digital Affairs Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski earlier described Russia's interference as ""unprecedented,"" alleging Moscow launched hybrid attacks to disrupt state functions and destabilize the electoral process.

The disinformation campaign coincides with a contentious presidential race. Polish voters are choosing among candidates, including Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, the frontrunner, and Poland 2050 leader Szymon Holownia.

Several candidates have drawn scrutiny for pro-Russian rhetoric.

Far-right candidate Slawomir Mentzen has connections to nationalist circles critical of Poland's support for Ukraine. Karol Nawrocki, backed by the conservative Law and Justice party, has been criticized for remarks seen as sympathetic to Moscow.

One episode that captured the attention of both Polish and Ukrainian media was Mentzen's spat with Lviv Mayor Andrii Sadovyi.

After visiting the western Ukrainian city on Feb. 24, Mentzen published a video near the monument to Stepan Bandera, calling the late Ukrainian nationalist a ""terrorist"" and accusing Ukraine of ""worshipping criminals.""

Bandera, assassinated by the KGB in 1959, led the radical wing of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and organized the assassination of Polish Interior Minister Bronislaw Pieracki.

The Polish election, with a potential runoff on June 1, comes as the country grapples with debates over national security, migration, and European integration.

At least two people were killed and 23 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over the past day, regional officials reported on May 18, as Moscow launched its largest single drone strike since the start of the full-scale invasion.

According to Ukraine's Air Force, Russia attacked with 273 drones overnight, including Iranian-designed Shahed-type suicide drones. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 88 drones, while another 128 vanished from radars, likely used as decoys to overwhelm the defense systems.

In Donetsk Oblast, a resident was killed in Yablunivka, and eight others were wounded across the region, Governor Vadym Filashkin said.

One person died and three more were injured in an overnight Russian drone attack in Kyiv Oblast, Governor Mykola Kalashnyk reported.

Russian attacks also injured eight people in Kherson Oblast and damaged an apartment building and three houses, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said.

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, two women, aged 48 and 52, were injured in Russian strikes, according to Governor Serhii Lysak.

The 13th Book Arsenal festival, one of Ukraine’s premier interdisciplinary cultural events attracting voices from across the country and around the globe, will take place in Kyiv from May 29 to June 1.

Over the course of four days, the festival offers a number of discussion panels, book presentations, public interviews, and even some film and musical performances that all relate to the theme of this year’s festival.

This year’s program is curated by American historian Marci Shore and Ukrainian journalist Oksana Forostyna, who together have shaped the events of the festival around the theme “Everything is Translation.”

The theme invites both participants and attendees to explore the untranslatable — and to consider what the gaps in language reveal about the invisible boundaries between cultures, perspectives, and human experience, particularly in times of war.

Each year, the festival’s curators choose a theme that reflects the cultural climate. Last year’s Book Arsenal, the first to take place since the start of the full-scale war, was centered around the theme “Life on the Edge.” In the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2021 theme was “Optimistis-Skeptics.”

“One of the most important tasks for the festival's team now is to create the safest and most inclusive festival space possible,” Yuliia Kozlovets, the director of Book Arsenal, told the Kyiv Independent.

“The theme of war is a cross-cutting one, when stands of military and volunteer initiatives are an organic part of the festival space. Because this is our Ukrainian contemporary culture, and this is our life today.”

For this year’s festival, the Kyiv Independent joins Book Arsenal as an official media partner, further underscoring its commitment to fostering critical dialogue and elevating Ukrainian voices on the world stage.

Several of the Kyiv Independent’s team members — editor-in-chief Olga Rudenko, chief executive officer Daryna Shevchenko, War Crimes Investigation Unit reporter Danylo Mokryk, and culture reporter Kate Tsurkan — will take part in panel discussions at this year’s Book Arsenal festival.

The full schedule for this year’s Book Arsenal is available on the festival’s website.

While events featuring international speakers on the main stage will be held in English, most of the program will be conducted in Ukrainian. However, several Ukrainian publishers — including Ukraїner, Projector, Rodovid, IST Publishing, and #knygolove — will offer a selection of their books in English translation for purchase.

Mystetskyi Arsenal’s art books, which highlight Ukraine’s artistic heritage, showcase prominent contemporary artists, and document experimental projects on key cultural movements, will also be available in bilingual Ukrainian-English editions.

The official opening of this year’s Book Arsenal festival is scheduled for 5 p.m. on May 29, but attendees can begin to enter the premises of Mystetskyi Arsenal, Kyiv’s National Art and Culture Museum Complex, from 4 p.m.

Tickets for the festival can be purchased online or at the ticket counter at Mystetskyi Arsenal – either 200 hryvnias ($5) for a one-day ticket of 500 hryvnias ($12) for all four days of the festival.

Editor’s note: Due to the security protocols of the unit featured in this story, the Ukrainian soldiers are identified by first name only.

Russia’s air strikes on Ukraine have become far more deadly in recent months.

Part of the uptick is due to limited air defense to bring down ballistic missiles. But Russia’s preferred deep-strike weapon — the Shahed drone — has gotten some major upgrades since the start of the year, including jet engines and Starlink satellite attachments, putting pressure on Ukraine’s already strained air defense.

The Iranian-designed Shaheds that Russia now manufactures itself have been an ever-present force in Russian air assaults on Ukraine since the fall of 2022. Long-range, high-flying, and cheap — flocks of Shaheds have become a default deep-strike weapon for Moscow.

Inbound Shahed swarms have become increasingly unpredictable and deadly in recent months, Oleksiy, the commander of a mobile air defense unit that for the past two years has guarded the northwest of Kyiv from these drones, told the Kyiv Independent.

Russia has been sending them in larger swarms — the biggest single drone attack since the start of the full-scale invasion, 273 drones, occurred overnight on May 18.

It's also outfitting them with jet engines, complicating the task facing air defense across the country.

Numbers scraped from the Ukrainian Air Force’s reports on Shaheds incoming, lost, and shot down also show a major uptick in their effectiveness, even as the total number of Shaheds Russia sends is on the decline. One hundred and eleven made it through in February, compared to 404 in March and 424 in April. Meanwhile, the number of Shaheds that the Air Force reported as launched dropped by about a third between March and April.

The increasing effectiveness of Shaheds is largely thanks to the new jet engines, which allow the drones to fly faster, carry bigger bombs, and maintain higher altitudes.

Oleksiy says most of those jet engine drones travel between 380 and 400 kilometers an hour. The team clocked their record of a Shahed traveling at 477 kilometers per hour in the latter half of March, which they show off on a screenshot from the radar-based mobile application that all Ukrainian air defense units share. A year before, the max speed was in the neighborhood of 200 kilometers per hour.

Similarly, the maximum payload that these Shaheds carry has tripled from about 30 kilograms to 90 kilograms. That remains a far cry from the 450 kilograms a cruise missile like the Kh-101 can carry, but Russia fields far more Shaheds.

The new engines also bring these Shaheds higher in the sky, as needed, reaching a ceiling of around 2 kilometers. The vertical range of a Browning machine gun like the one that Oleksiy shoots is, he says, more like 1,800 meters. Shoulder-mounted surface-to-air missiles like the Soviet Igla and American Stingers work at higher ranges, but are in shorter supply.

Russia does, however, face some limits in adding jet engines to Shaheds. They are more expensive than the two-stroke piston engines — replicas of the U.S.-made MD550 — that Shaheds started out the war with. Russia often has to import jet engine technology, sometimes with Western components delivered through third parties to get around sanctions.

About half of the Shaheds that radar picks up coming into Ukraine are “dummy” drones — no warheads, and so generally cheaper while distracting enemy fire. Many of those show up in the data as “Lost/Fell.”

The actual material of a typical Shahed is remarkably flimsy relative to what one would imagine of a weapon of war. Water condenses with the cold further up in the atmosphere, which has typically weakened the Shahed’s structure. The team says the Shaheds are getting a new coating that makes them more resistant to the moisture they run into higher up.

“At lower altitudes, we have something like five or six seconds to work, when we need to find, target, and destroy them.”

Russia also frequently flies Shaheds low, which is dangerous because, while are easier to hit, they are harder to detect. Land-based radar signals, the core of Ukrainian identification, don’t return good location data on Shaheds flying below the horizon.

Indeed, the team's radars picked up the 477-kilometer-per-hour Shahed at 300 meters above ground. Some glide as low as 100 meters above ground, giving satellites and mobile teams a tiny window of time in which to spot and shoot them down.

“At lower altitudes, we have something like five or six seconds to work, when we need to find, target, and destroy them,” said Oleksiy. More over-the-horizon radar would, he said, go a long way for groups like theirs.

The Shaheds have historically also run fairly robotically along pre-planned flight paths. Now, some are avoiding spotlights like the one that one team member of the unit, Svita, uses to spot them in the sky. Light avoidance could be new programming added to Shahed visual guidance, Oleksiy explained.

Their dependence on visual guidance, however, meant that Shaheds clung to familiar routes for most of the time they’ve been flying over Ukraine. “They used to lay out a route for the Shahed, and it would go right along the route. It was simple to destroy them. At the moment, they react to light; that is, if you turn on the flashlights, they start making maneuvers,” said Oleksiy.

Those on the way to Kyiv often stuck to the Dnipro River or the sleek new Odesan Highway that is the main thoroughfare southward to the Black Sea and the titular town, Ukraine’s second-largest. That also seems to have changed recently.

“A few of them are actively guided, that is, they are being steered online. They film our positions, see us, and record us, so later they try to fly around us,” said Oleksiy.

The coordinator for a number of these regional mobile defense units specified to the Kyiv Independent that some of these Shaheds are also flying with Starlink Terminals that keep them connected to pilots in Russia in flight.

Ukraine’s mobile defense teams have also gotten far better at shooting down drones over the past two years. Oleksiy told the Kyiv Independent that his team managed to shoot down six Shaheds flying through their little quadrant of the Ukrainian sky during March.

The team’s central tool is a truck-mounted Browning machine gun. A major upgrade over the past two years has been the distribution of thermal vision across the front line, which can work in times when Svita’s spotlight cannot.

The actual hardware many use is not that complicated, certainly not compared to what air defense groups aiming for cruise or ballistic missiles use. But these air defense teams have to work in close coordination across the entire country because Russia combines its attacks of drones and missiles and feint take-offs and launches of various MiG airplanes from airfields within range of Ukraine.

But Ukraine’s air defense communications are leaps and bounds ahead of where they were in 2022. Applications like Visage — developed just before the full-scale invasion — have radically improved their ability to track incoming air attacks. They are also integrated with the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ ubiquitous Delta mapping and communications application.

Even thermal vision targeting and shooting are linked via a tablet application. These days, mobile air groups around the country effectively share screens on the application live.

Oleksiy shows off a grayscale but high-resolution hit from another team in Chernihiv Oblast, firing on a Shahed that erupts into red flames.

“Looks good, right?” Oleksiy chuckled. “Like something out of the movies.”

Ukraine's armed forces have ""hit"" 1,159 Russian tanks since the beginning of 2025, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on May 17.

""Ukrainian soldiers continue to destroy the enemy and his equipment,"" he said in a post on Facebook.

""Since the beginning of this year alone, the Defense Forces have hit more than one thousand occupying tanks (1,159) and more than two and a half thousand war-armored vehicles (2,510),"" he added.

Syrskyi did not specify if the military vehicles had been damaged or destroyed, but Ukraine's General Staff on May 18 reported Russia has also lost 10,832 tanks since the start of the full-scale invasion.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the figures.

At the start of the full-scale invasion, Russia was estimated to have around 3,300 operational tanks, suggesting that all those that initially drove into Ukraine and then some, have been taken out over the course of two-and-a-half years.

It's impossible to know for certain exactly how many tanks Russia has lost during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, so any figures need to be treated as estimates.

Further complicating matters is what exactly Ukraine's General Staff counts as a ""tank,"" with Ukraine's official count being plausible, yet most likely misleading.

""The daily figures from Kyiv just say tanks, but because it has a separate section for armored personnel vehicles, so it's my interpretation that they group main battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles,"" Sascha Bruchmann, visiting research fellow for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), told the Kyiv Independent last year.

Figures from the open-source investigative project Oryx put the number of tanks damaged or destroyed at 3,984.

How many tanks does Russia have left?

At the beginning of its full-scale invasion, Russia had around 3,330 operational tanks, according to the Military Balance 2021 database.

The database included all tank types then employed by Russia’s military, notably T-72s, T-80s, and T-90s, and their modifications.

Clearly, the most recent figures of Russian tanks destroyed would mean almost the entire tank fleet employed by the Kremlin at the start of the full-scale invasion had been destroyed.

But Russia had thousands of tanks in storage which it has been forced to use as the war dragged on far beyond what the Kremlin initially envisaged.

A September 2023 report by the Institut Action Résilience using OSINT data calculated Russia has an estimated maximum of 7,000 tanks in storage.

Can Russia replace lost tanks?

Russia does have the capacity to replace the tanks it had lost since February 2022, though there's a massive caveat.

While Russia can maintain the quantity of tanks at the front, the quality is diminishing all the time, experts say.

Retired military officer and defense expert Viktor Kevliuk told the Kyiv Independent last year, the ""figure (of destroyed tanks) means that the enemy has lost almost all of the modern tanks that it had at the beginning of the invasion.""

""The capabilities of Russian industry to produce modern tanks are extremely limited, with 100-200 tanks per year,"" he adds.

""The bulk of the tanks supplied to the front are restored machines from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.""",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2136579128.jpg

Russia carried out its largest single drone attack since the start of its full-scale invasion, launching 273 drones overnight on May 18, Ukraine's Air Force reported.

The attack comes just two days after Ukraine and Russia held their first direct peace talks since 2022, and one day ahead of a planned call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Kyiv Oblast Governor Mykola Kalashnyk reported that the attack killed one person and injured three others. Actual casualties from the attack are still being clarified, he said.

Kyiv Independent journalists in the capital heard multiple explosions throughout the night as air defenses worked.

Ukraine's Air Force said it intercepted 88 drones, while 128 others vanished from radars, likely used as decoys to overwhelm air defenses. The air defense involved the coordinated use of electronic warfare units, mobile fire teams, and anti-aircraft systems.

The previous largest drone attack of the full-scale invasion occurred on Feb. 23, when 267 drones entered Ukrainian airspace, Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said at the time.

Despite increasing international pressure for an unconditional ceasefire, Moscow has intensified its assaults, displaying ongoing resistance to and disdain for diplomatic efforts.

The Russian delegation at the May 16 peace talks in Istanbul consisted solely of lower-ranking officials, despite the Kremlin proposing the discussions. President Volodymyr Zelensky had called on Putin to attend personally, saying only the Russian leader could authorize a ceasefire.

Russian negotiators reiterated sweeping demands: that Ukraine abandon NATO aspirations, renounce foreign military support, drop reparations claims, and accept Russian control over Crimea and four occupied regions — demands Kyiv has categorically rejected.

Trump has pushed to broker a deal but has yet to impose new sanctions on Moscow despite mounting frustration from U.S. allies over Russia's refusal to halt its attacks.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he will be speaking, by telephone, to President Vladimir Putin of Russia on Monday, at 10 a.m.

Trump’s comments come as peace talks in Istanbul on May 16 ended with no breakthrough, and Russia once again issued sweeping demands, including Ukraine’s adoption of neutral status, dropping claims for war reparations from Moscow and the recognition of its loss of Crimea and four occupied regions none of which Russia fully controls.

""The subjects of the call will be stopping the 'bloodbath' that is killing, on average, more than 5,000 Russian and Ukrainian soldiers a week, and trade,"" he wrote on Truth Social.

""I will then be speaking to President Zelensky of Ukraine and then, with President Zelensky, various members of NATO,"" he added. ""Hopefully it will be a productive day, a ceasefire will take place, and this very violent war — a war that should have never happened — will end. God bless us all!!!""

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed to Russia's state-owned TASS news agency on May 17 that the preparations for the call are on the way.

Following his Middle East trip, Trump told Fox News’ Bret Baier in an interview published on May 16 that he believes Putin is ready to strike a deal to end the war in Ukraine, but warned that if negotiations fail, his administration will move forward with sanctions against Moscow.

""Honestly, I will (impose sanctions), if we're not gonna make a deal,"" Trump said. ""This is turkey time, we’re talking turkey, and we’ll see what happens. This would be crushing for Russia because they're having a hard time now with the economy, oil prices are low.""

Trump said he believes a deal won't be possible without his involvement and expressed plans to meet with Putin soon, adding: ""I have a very good relationship with Putin.""

Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held a phone call on May 17, reportedly initiated by the U.S., to discuss bilateral relations and recent peace talks in Istanbul, Russian state media said.

Latest: Ukraine's General Staff responds after accusations of 'stupid objectives' from 47th Brigade battalion commander.

Oleksandr Shyrshyn, battalion commander of the 47 Separate Mechanized Brigade, has submitted his resignation, sharply criticizing Ukraine’s military leadership for what he described as senseless orders and unnecessary casualties.

""I have never received more stupid objectives than in the current direction,"" Shyrshyn wrote in a blunt Facebook post announcing his decision on May 16. ""Someday I will tell you the details, but the stupid loss of people, trembling in front of a stupid generals, leads to nothing but failures.""

""I hope your children will also serve in the infantry and carry out your orders,"" he added

Ukraine's General Staff, who was tagged in Shyrshyn's post, had not commented on the matter at the time of the publication.

The Kyiv Independent reported in 2023 that the brigade, which was formed from scratch in 2022 and is often known by the name “Magura,"" was prepared with the summer 2023 counteroffensive in mind; its soldiers were trained in NATO countries and equipped with superior new Western equipment.

In 2024, the brigade was engaged in combat operations within Russia's Kursk Oblast.

Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first major foreign ground offensive into Russian territory since World War II. The operation sought to delay a planned Russian push into Ukraine’s Sumy Oblast and redirect Russian forces away from eastern Donetsk Oblast.

Moscow began a major counteroffensive in early March, retaking large portions of territory including the town of Sudzha. Ukrainian forces have since withdrawn from much of the area but still maintain limited control in some zones as of late April despite Russia's claims that its forces have fully recaptured the territory of the region.

Meanwhile, Shyrshyn on May 16 accused the military command of focusing on punishments rather than results. ""All they are capable of is reprimands, investigations, imposition of penalties. Everyone is going to hell,"" he wrote. ""Political games and assessment of the real state of affairs do not correspond to either reality or possibilities. They played games.""

During the meeting, the Canadian prime minister expressed his admiration for Ukraine and its people.

“We admire what you are doing. We admire your commitment to peace, which you have demonstrated again this week. And let me underscore that there can be no peace without the full support and participation of Ukraine – and that you have our absolute support,” Carney said.

Zelensky also shared the details of what was discussed during the meeting, naming the conditions needed for a lasting peace in Ukraine.

""We discussed what is needed to bring a lasting peace closer. The key priority is to apply pressure on Russia in a way that compels real steps toward ending the war,"" Zelensky asserted.

Speaking to reporters in Rome ahead of his meeting with Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, the Vatican’s point man on Ukraine, Rubio said he would discuss ""the status of the talks, the updates after yesterday (Friday), and the path forward,"" according to Associated Press.

Asked whether the Vatican could act as a peace broker, Rubio responded: ""I wouldn’t call it broker, but it’s certainly — I think it’s a place that both sides would be comfortable going.""

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has announced stronger surveillance and additional sanctions targeting Russia's so-called ""shadow fleet"" following suspected sabotage of underwater infrastructure in the Baltic Sea, Die Zeit reported on May 17.

""The threat has intensified over recent months,"" Wadephul said. ""Severed cables, disrupted signals, and suspicious vessels are of serious concern to us.""

Recently, a series of incidents involved severed cables and disrupted signals in the Baltic Sea region. While U.S. and European intelligence officials have suggested some of the damage may have been accidental, some senior officials, argue that repeated disruptions cannot be explained by ""poor seamanship"" alone.

Wadephul said Germany and its allies are responding to hybrid threats in the Baltic region with increased patrols and renewed pressure on Russia's covert shipping operations.

""Russia threatens all of us in the Baltic region,"" he said. ""We as residents, NATO and the EU are facing hybrid threats with all our might, including further patrol.""

The so-called shadow fleet consists of oil tankers and other cargo ships used by Russia to circumvent Western sanctions, particularly in transporting oil. In recent months, suspected acts of sabotage linked to this fleet have drawn attention to vulnerabilities in undersea cables and pipelines, prompting intensified monitoring of maritime infrastructure.

Calling the fleet a ""direct security threat,"" Wadephul said the European Union will impose fresh sanctions on vessels enabling Russia to bypass restrictions. ""This also helps Ukraine, because the shadow fleet moves oil every day that Russia sells around the sanctions,"" he added.

On May 14, EU ambassadors agreed on the bloc's 17th package of sanctions against Russia, primarily targeting its shadow fleet of oil tankers.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the move, insisting it would ""keep the pressure high on the Kremlin.""

But outside the EU bubble, critics see it as another incremental move that fails to match the urgency of the moment, and behind closed doors, even EU officials acknowledge the package was watered down during negotiations.

A Russian-installed court in eastern Ukraine has sentenced Australian national Oscar Jenkins to 13 years in a high-security penal colony, accusing him of fighting as a mercenary against Russian forces, pro-Kremlin officials said on May 16.

The so-called Supreme Court of the Russian-controlled Luhansk Oblast found Jenkins guilty under Russian criminal law for participating in armed conflict as a mercenary.

The Kremlin argues that mercenaries are not protected under international law as prisoners of war and are subject to criminal prosecution.

The court claimed Jenkins arrived in Ukraine in February 2024 from Melbourne and signed a contract with the Ukrainian Defense Ministry at a recruitment center in Ternopil. He was then allegedly deployed to Donetsk Oblast.

Jenkins, who served in the Ukrainian army's 402nd Separate Rifle Battalion, which is part of Ukraine's 66th Separate Mechanized Brigade, was reported missing near Mykolaivka in Luhansk Oblast on Dec. 16, 2024. Russian forces later confirmed his capture.

Unlike most other foreigners volunteering to join Ukraine's resistance against Russia, Jenkins has had no military experience. The Australian media described the man as ""much loved"" by his community in Australia, a talented cricket and football player who studied biomedical sciences before working as a lecturer in China. He is believed to have traveled to Ukraine in 2024.

The Russian FSB said it had investigated Jenkins' case and accused him of engaging in ""criminal activity"" until his arrest in December. His trial and sentencing were conducted by authorities not internationally recognized and operating under Moscow's control.

Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong condemned the sentencing, calling it a ""sham trial.""

""We continue to hold serious concerns for Mr. Jenkins. We are working with Ukraine and other partners, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, to advocate for his welfare and release,"" Wong said in a statement on May 17.

Wong reiterated Australia's position that Jenkins should be treated in accordance with international humanitarian law, and that Russia's refusal to recognize him as a prisoner of war violates legal norms.

Australia has been pressing for Jenkins' release since he was captured. His case drew international attention after Russian media aired footage in December 2024 purporting to show him being interrogated and beaten. While some outlets later raised doubts about the authenticity of related video materials, Russia eventually confirmed to Australia that Jenkins was in custody and in ""normal"" health.

Russia also confirmed the agreement, with Vladimir Medinsky, head of Moscow's delegation, telling Russian state media that preparations for the swap were underway. Deputy Intelligence Chief Vadym Skybytskyi said both countries had begun working on the final exchange lists.

Prisoner swaps remain one of the few areas of ongoing cooperation between the two countries. The most recent exchange occurred on May 6, when 205 Ukrainian soldiers were returned in a one-for-one format.

Ukraine has long advocated for an ""all-for-all"" exchange, but Russia has so far resisted the proposal. Kyiv has not disclosed the total number of Ukrainian prisoners of war being held in Russian custody.

Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree simplifying the process for residents of Georgia’s Russian-occupied territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia to obtain Russian citizenship, Russian state-controlled media reported on May 17.

According to the decree, all adult ""citizens"" of Abkhazia and South Ossetia who held that status as of Aug. 26, 2008, the day Russia recognized the territories as ""independent,"" are now eligible to apply for Russian citizenship through an expedited process. Applicants are required only to submit a formal request for citizenship.

Moscow gained full control over Abkhazia and South Ossetia following its 2008 invasion of Georgia and has since maintained a military presence in both regions.

Russia has employed similar tactics in Ukraine.

In August 2024, Russia’s Interior Ministry claimed it had issued 2.2 million Russian passports to residents of the occupied Ukrainian territories — Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk, and Luhansk — since October 2022. The figure was published by ministry official Irina Volk on her Telegram channel. The claim could not be independently verified.

The U.S.-based Ukraine Conflict Observatory reported in 2023 that Russia systematically coerces residents of occupied Ukrainian regions into accepting Russian citizenship, often under threat of detention, deportation, or the loss of access to basic services.

Refusal to accept Russian documentation has reportedly resulted in the denial of medical care, employment, humanitarian aid, and other critical support.

During the massive flooding of the Kherson Oblast following the breach of the Kakhovka Dam, Russia allowed evacuations only to Russian passport holders, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported.

Putin first introduced a simplified citizenship process for Ukrainians in occupied territories in July 2022. In April 2023, he signed another decree setting a deadline in the summer of 2024 for residents in those areas to obtain Russian passports or face legal and civil consequences.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1371843319.jpg

In the past 24 hours, Russian attacks have killed at least 13 people and injured 32 across Ukraine, according to local athorities.

Russian forces launched a massive drone assault across Ukraine overnight, using 62 drones including Shahed-type attack UAVs and decoy drones from Russia and occupied Crimea, according to Ukraine’s Air Force.

Ukrainian air defenses shot down 36 drones over multiple regions. Six decoy UAVs were lost through electronic warfare and did not reach their targets.

In Odesa Oblast, Russian drones hit civilian infrastructure in two districts, Odesa Regional Prosecutor's Office said. Three people were injured by shrapnel, explosive blasts and burns while sheltering in their homes. Private houses, farm buildings and vehicles were damaged. Prosecutors opened investigations into the strikes as possible war crimes.

In Kherson Oblast, an FPV drone struck a garbage truck around 9 a.m. in Kherson city, injuring three municipal workers. The men were hospitalized with blast injuries and concussions, local officials said.

In Sumy Oblast, a drone strike hit a passenger bus near the town of Bilopillia, killing nine people and injuring seven others. Throughout the day, Russian forces launched 85 attacks on 31 settlements in 13 communities, local authorities reported. Guided bombs, rockets and drone-dropped grenades damaged homes and infrastructure in two communities. Authorities evacuated 69 people from front-line areas.

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, drones struck several villages throughout the day. No casualties were reported, though local authorities issued air raid alerts in parts of the region.

In Kharkiv Oblast, strikes on 10 communities killed one person in Kupiansk and injured at least nine people, governor said. Russian forces used a mix of rockets, guided bombs, Shahed drones, Lancet and Molniya drones, and FPV drones. Damage was reported to homes, businesses and critical infrastructure across multiple districts.

In Donetsk Oblast, shelling hit 18 towns and villages, killing three civilians and injuring at least 10 others. Local authorities evacuated 181 people, including 38 children, from front-line communities, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/IMAGE-2025-05-17-11-42-16.jpg

The identity of Ukraine's signatory is a ""fundamental"" issue for Russia in any potential agreement to end the war, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on May 17 during a briefing, Russian state-controlled media reported.

""For Russia, the most important and principal matter when signing documents between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations is the identity of the person authorized to sign on behalf of Ukraine,"" Peskov told reporters.

His comments come as Russia and Ukraine held a new round of negotiations in Istanbul on May 16. Although no ceasefire agreement was reached, both sides agreed to a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner-of-war exchange.

Ukrainian officials said Russia had demanded a full military withdrawal from four regions, Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson, which Moscow claims to have annexed, despite not controlling them entirely. Kyiv rejected the demand and expressed doubts about the Russian delegation's authority to make decisions.

Peskov said work on a settlement will continue and added that a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky could be possible if the two delegations reach sufficient agreement.

The Kremlin also said it would inform the public if Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump decide to hold a phone call.

Peskov's comments also confirm that negotiations remain open.

""The Russian Federation will prepare and hand over to Ukraine a list of conditions for a ceasefire,"" Peskov said.

Following the Istanbul talks, Zelensky, together with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, held a call with Trump to discuss next steps.

Western officials remain skeptical of Russia's intentions, especially after the Kremlin sent a low-level delegation to Istanbul, omitting senior figures such as Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Zelensky described the Russian team as a ""sham delegation.""

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Russia launched a drone strike in Sumy Oblast in the early morning of May 17, killing nine people and injuring seven more.

The drone targeted a shuttle bus that was transporting civilians near the city of Bilopillia at 6:17 a.m. local time, the Sumy Regional Military Administration reported on Telegram.

Sumy Oblast is a northeastern region that borders Russia's Kursk, Belgorod, and Bryansk oblasts.

Yurii Zarko, head of Bilopillia, called the day ""a black Saturday"" in the city's history and declared three days of mourning from May 17 to 19.

""This bus was carrying people out of the city for evacuation,"" Zarko told Suspilne. ""The wounded were treated at the scene and then transferred to a hospital in Sumy. We are currently retrieving the bodies. Some victims have not yet been identified. Most of them are elderly women, along with two or three men.""

Emergency services and police are currently working at the scene.

In a statement later on May 17, President Zelensky confirmed that all nine of the victims were civilians and said a family was among those killed.



""According to preliminary information, the Russians killed a family: a father, mother, and daughter died in the strike,"" Zelensky said. ""The Russians could not have failed to know what kind of vehicle they were targeting.""

He said seven people remained hospitalized with burns, fractures, and concussions, but were receiving appropriate care.

Zelensky also urged for stronger international pressure on Russia following the collapse of peace talks in Istanbul earlier this week.

""Yesterday, like on any day of this war, there was a chance to stop the fire. Ukraine has long proposed a full and unconditional ceasefire to save lives,"" he said. ""Russia preserves only one thing — its ability to keep killing.""

Kyiv and its allies have proposed an unconditional 30-day ceasefire beginning on May 12 as a first step toward peace — a proposal that Russia has so far ignored.

Local residents in Sumy Oblast often experience multiple attacks per day, with border areas suffering from artillery and glide bomb strikes, and the regional center of Sumy coming under missile and drone strikes.

Most recently, Russia has been deploying small assault groups to infiltrate the region in a bid to expand the front line.

The latest attack on Sumy follows recent peace talks in Istanbul, where Russia rejected a ceasefire and reiterated its maximalist demands in the war against Ukraine.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/05/jz3234---c16x9x50px50p--c0291ee1e7d6d50309c29c01e066f26c.webp

Ukrainian security service drones struck an ammunition depot used by Russia's 126th Coastal Defense Brigade near the village of Perevalne in occupied Crimea, causing a large explosion and fire, a security source told the Kyiv Independent on May 17.

The depot, located near a key highway between Simferopol and Alushta, reportedly housed military equipment, ammunition, and fuel storage facilities. Local residents reportedly described thick smoke over the military compound.

""The Security Service of Ukraine continues to effectively strike legitimate military targets in Russian-occupied Crimea. Efforts to degrade (Russia's) military capabilities will continue,"" the source said.

The strike reportedly caused significant damage and prompted Russian forces to block traffic along the Simferopol–Alushta highway, which passes close to the affected area. There are also reports of Russian military personnel killed in the blast, the source said.

Russia has not officially commented on the incident. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims.

Ukraine has ramped up long-range drone strikes and sabotage operations in occupied Crimea in recent months, targeting Russian military infrastructure and logistics hubs.

President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on April 7 that Ukraine is increasing production across ""the full range of drones: from Mavics to long-range drones,"" as well as ground-based robotic systems.

Ukraine and Russia have increasingly relied on drone warfare throughout the war, deploying aerial, naval, and ground-based drones for reconnaissance and strike operations. Zelensky also noted progress in Ukraine's capacity for ""deep strikes"" — long-range drone attacks targeting Russian military infrastructure far behind the front lines.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1243954958.jpeg

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that Russian hackers targeted websites of parties in his ruling coalition just two days before the country's presidential election, AP reported on May 16.

Tusk said the cyberattacks hit the website of his Civic Platform party, as well as those of its coalition partners, the Left and the Polish People's Party (PSL).

""Two days before the elections, a group of Russian hackers operating on Telegram attacked the websites of the Civic Platform,"" Tusk wrote on the social platform X. ""Our services are conducting intensive operations. The attack is still on.""

The frontrunner in Sunday’s vote is Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, a senior member of Civic Platform.

Polish authorities are also investigating paid political ads on Facebook that a state research institute flagged as possible election interference. The National Research and Academic Computer Network, known by its Polish acronym NASK, said it reported the misleading ads to Meta, which owns Facebook, and that the ads were removed.

""Ad accounts involved in the campaign have spent more on political content than any election committee in the past seven days,"" NASK said in a statement on May 14, claiming that actions were ""intended to ostensibly support one of the candidates and discredit others.""

Poland has faced a surge in cyberattacks in recent years. In late 2024, officials reported up to 1,000 daily cyber incidents believed to be carried out by Russian and Belarusian actors. Authorities have linked the attacks to Poland's support for Ukraine amid Russia's full-scale invasion.

In September 2024, the Polish government accused Russia and Belarus of extorting information, blackmailing individuals and institutions, and waging ""de facto cyberwar.""

Russian hybrid operations in Europe are becoming more frequent and aggressive, especially since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, the EBU Investigative Journalism Network reported in January, citing 20 government, military, and intelligence officials from 10 countries.

Ukraine and Europe in March signed a memorandum of understanding to support joint research, innovation, and EU-funded projects in cross-border cybersecurity projects.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202961314.jpg
