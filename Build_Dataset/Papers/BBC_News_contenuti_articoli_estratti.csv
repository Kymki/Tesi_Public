President Volodymyr Zelensky shared images of soldiers celebrating as they returned to Ukraine

Russia said a ""similar number"" of prisoners of war had been returned to Ukraine, though neither side provided an exact figure for how many people had been exchanged.

Writing on Telegram, Zelensky said: ""The process is quite complicated, there are many sensitive details, negotiations continue virtually every day.""

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the exchange would unfold ""in several stages"" over the coming days, adding that the wounded, seriously wounded and soldiers under 25 were being returned.

A prisoner exchange is under way between Russia and Ukraine, governments in Moscow and Kyiv have confirmed.

Russia's defence ministry said ""the first group of Russian servicemen under the age of 25 were returned from the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime"" following an agreement reached between the warring countries last week during talks in Turkey.

As with past exchanges, Moscow said the exchanged Russian soldiers were receiving psychological and medical assistance in Belarus.

On the Ukrainian side, relatives of prisoners of war and the missing gathered in the Chernihiv region, close to the border with Belarus, to greet the released prisoners and, in many cases, seek news of others still in captivity.

Last week, Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of disrupting the planned repatriation of the bodies of dead soldiers.

In late May, Russia and Ukraine each handed over 390 soldiers and civilians in the biggest prisoner exchange since Russia launched the full-scale invasion in 2022.

Meanwhile, war continued overnight, with Moscow launching a record 479 drones at Ukraine, including on the western region of Rivne that had been largely spared from attacks.

Russia's defence ministry said it had targeted Rivne's Dubno base and described this as ""one of the retaliatory strikes"" in response to Ukraine's audacious drone attacks on Russian airfields on 1 June.

The overnight Russian launches caused damage in several Ukrainian regions but there were no reports of casualties.

Russia has recently escalated its attacks on Ukraine, with each week bringing a new record of drones fired at the country.

For its part, Kyiv said it attacked another Russian airbase in the Nizhny Novgorod region, which lies 400 miles from the Ukrainian border.

Ukraine said the base houses planes that launch hypersonic missiles and that it had damaged ""two units of enemy aircraft"".

It also targeted an electronics factory that Kyiv says manufactures equipment to guide drones and aerial bombs.

Watch: Firefighters battle flames after Kharkiv apartments hit by Russian strikes

Russia has hit Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, with a massive drone and bomber attack, killing four people and injuring nearly 60, officials say. Two people were also killed in Russian strikes on Kherson, in southern Ukraine, local authorities said. Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said 48 drones, two missiles and four glide bombs had been used against his city on Friday night, while more glide bombs were reportedly dropped on Saturday. Earlier, Moscow said a massive wave of drone and missile attacks across Ukraine on Thursday night was in response to ""terrorist attacks by the Kyiv regime"", after attacks on Russian railway infrastructure and air bases last weekend.

In another development, Russian and Ukrainian officials released conflicting accounts about when a prisoner swap agreed at earlier talks would happen. In Kharkiv, some 18 apartment buildings and 13 other homes were hit on Friday night, the mayor said. A baby and a 14-year-old girl were among the injured, he added. One civilian industrial facility was attacked by 40 drones, one missile and four bombs, Kharkiv governor Oleh Syniehubov said, adding that there might still be people buried under the rubble. In the later Russian attack using glide bombs on Kharkiv on Saturday evening, one more person was killed and at least another 18 people injured, the city's mayor said. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha urged allies to increase pressure on Moscow and to take ""more steps to strengthen Ukraine"" in response to Russia's latest attacks. Six people were killed and 80 injured across Ukraine on Thursday night, when Russia attacked the country with more than 400 drones and nearly 40 missiles.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the strikes on Kharkiv made ""no military sense"" and were ""pure terrorism"". He accused his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, of ""buying himself time to keep waging the war"", and said ""pressure must be applied"" to stop the attacks. During the latest round of direct talks in Istanbul earlier this week, the two warring sides agreed to exchange all sick and heavily wounded prisoners of war, those aged under 25, as well as the bodies of 12,000 soldiers. Moscow's chief negotiator at the meeting, Vladimir Medinsky, said on Saturday that Ukraine had ""unexpectedly postponed both the acceptance of bodies and the exchange of prisoners of war for an indefinite period"". He further said that the bodies of more than 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been taken to an agreed exchange point but that Ukrainian officials had never arrived. A list of 640 prisoners-of-war had also been handed to Ukraine ""in order to begin the exchange"", Medinsky wrote on social media. Ukrainian officials responded angrily to the allegations, telling Russia to ""stop playing dirty games"".

A statement from Ukraine's Co-ordination for PoWs office said that the comments did ""not correspond to reality or to previous agreements"". The Co-ordination HQ said both sides had been working on preparations for the exchange over the past week and alleged that Russia was not sticking to the agreed parameters of the swap. It added that Ukraine had submitted its PoW lists according to the ""clearly defined categories"" of the deal, but that Russia had submitted ""alternative lists that do not correspond to the agreed-upon approach"". While an agreement on the repatriation of bodies had been reached, a date had not been set, Ukraine said, with Russia taking ""unilateral steps that had not been co-ordinated"". Russian air strikes over the past two nights came after bomb attacks on railways in western Russia reportedly killed seven people and injured more than 100, and Ukrainian drone strikes targeted strategic warplanes at four air bases deep inside Russia. Ukraine's security service SBU said at least 40 Russian aircraft had been struck during ""Operation Spider's Web"" last Sunday.

Russia launches drone and missile attack on Kyiv

Russia launched a ""massive"" drone and missile strike on Ukraine's capital and other areas early on Friday, days after Ukraine's surprise attack on its air bases. Five people were killed and 80 injured, Ukrainian officials said, with cruise missiles and hundreds of drones launched. Strikes targeted the capital Kyiv, and the northern city of Chernihiv, as well as Lutsk and Ternopil in the north-west. Russia said the strikes were in response to ""terrorist acts by the Kyiv regime"", saying military sites were targeted. Moscow also reported downing 174 Ukrainian drones over parts of Russia and occupied Crimea. Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles, it said, were intercepted over the Black Sea.

Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russia's defence ministry said its armed forces had ""launched a massive strike with high-precision long-range air, sea and ground-based weapons, as well as attack drones"" on Thursday night. The attack came after Putin warned US President Donald Trump he would respond to Ukraine's recent strikes in several Russian regions. Late on Friday, Trump told reporters that the Ukrainians had given ""Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them last night"". Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov described the war in Ukraine as ""existential"" for Russia, saying it was an ""issue of our national interests, an issue of our security"". Moscow blamed Ukraine for three bomb attacks on railways in Russia's western Bryansk and Kursk regions which reportedly killed seven people and injured more than 100 last weekend. Kyiv has not commented on those attacks. Ukraine did say however that it had carried out its largest long-range drone strikes on at least 40 Russian warplanes at four military bases deep inside Russia last Sunday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said 117 drones had been used in Operation Spider Web by the SBU security service , striking ""34% of [Russia's] strategic cruise missile carriers"". Ukrainian officials say Russia's latest aerial assault included 38 cruise missiles, the kind Ukraine targeted on Sunday. Ukraine's state emergencies service DSNS said the three people killed in Kyiv had all been its employees. One person was killed in Lutsk, and the body of another victim was pulled from the wreckage in Chernihiv late on Friday. Zelensky said the Russian attack had used more than 400 drones. ""Now is exactly the moment when America, Europe, and everyone around the world can stop this war together by pressuring Russia,"" he added. In a thinly veiled reference to Trump's apparent unwillingness to put pressure on Russia, he added: ""If someone is not applying pressure and is giving the war more time to take lives – that is complicity and accountability.""

Ros Atkins on... how Ukraine did Operation Spider Web

Air raid alerts were in place in Kyiv, where a residential building was hit, and the city's metro system was disrupted after shelling damaged tracks. Tens of thousands of civilians in the capital spent a restless few hours in underground shelters. From the centre of the city, prolonged bursts of machine gun fire could be heard as air defences on the outskirts attempted to bring down scores of drones aimed at the capital. From time to time, the distinctive buzz of drones overhead could also be heard. Bright flashes of light, sometimes reflected on nearby buildings, would be followed, five or 10 seconds later, by thunderous explosions. In Ternopil, military chief Vyacheslav Negoda said Friday's strike had been the ""most massive air attack on our region to date"", injuring five people and damaging homes and schools.

BBC Tatyana Popvytch's son was taken to Russia. ""He is so vulnerable,"" she said. ""I worry that he will lose his sanity there.""

Tatyana Popovytch had contacted every agency she could think of. She had walked every step her son Vladislav could have taken after the Russians opened fire at his car, leaving him to flee with a bullet in his leg. She had looked in mass graves, reviewed pictures of the dead, watched exhumations. And after a month, she knew no more than when she had started. Then a stranger called. Serhii had just been released from a Russian prison in Kursk. At morning roll call, the prisoners could not see one another, but they could hear each person state their full name and home village. Serhii memorised as many names and places as he could – 10 in total, he said – and on 9 May 2022 he called Tatyana to say that he had heard her son's voice. Like Vladislav, Serhii was a civilian captured from Bucha at the start of the war, when hundreds of civilians were taken from this area. Vladislav was 29 at the time. Now 32, he is still in the prison in Kursk. Serhii couldn't explain to Tatyana why he had been released and Vladislav hadn't. Tatyana was just glad to hear that her son was alive. ""I was so overjoyed I lost the stutter I'd had since he was taken,"" she said. Three years later, to the day, Tatyana was sitting in a café in Bucha, not far from where her son was abducted, looking over the scant evidence that he was still alive: two letters from him – short, boilerplate texts, written in Russian, telling her he was well fed and well looked after. Each letter had taken around three months to reach Tatyana, making it hard for her to feel very connected to her son at any point in time. ""My son is very gentle and sensitive,"" she said, with the pained expression of a parent who cannot protect their child. She was looking at pictures of Vlad ballroom dancing – a hobby from a young age. ""He is so vulnerable,"" she said. ""I worry that he will lose his sanity there.""

According to Ukrainian authorities, nearly 16,000 Ukrainian civilians are still in captivity in Russian prisons after being abducted by the invading army – not counting the more than 20,000 Ukrainian children estimated to have been taken to Russia. There are growing fears now among their many thousands of loved ones, amid the apparent progress towards peace talks, that they could be forgotten or lost in the process. And those fears appear to be justified. Under the Geneva Convention, there is a recognised mechanism for exchanging prisoners of war, but no such mechanism exists for the return of captured civilians, leaving even top Ukrainian and international officials searching for an explanation as to how they might be brought home. ""When I attend official meetings, at the ombudsman's office or elsewhere, no one talks about getting the civilians back in the event of a ceasefire,"" said Yulia Hripun, 23, whose father was kidnapped early on in the war from a village just west of Kyiv. In the weeks after learning of her father's captivity, Yulia used Facebook to contact another daughter of an imprisoned Ukrainian and the pair launched a new organisation to campaign for all the civilians' release. The group has met representatives from the UN, the European Parliament, the governments of several EU countries and the US embassy in Ukraine. ""We spoke with them but it came down to the fact that they honestly don't understand what's going to happen,"" Yulia said, of meeting the Americans. ""The only thing they said is that Trump is interested in the issue of deported children and that maybe civilians could somehow fit into that category. But they are actually different categories that can't be combined."" Worryingly for Yulia and other relatives of the captured civilians, top Ukrainian officials are not pretending to have a stronger idea. ""I do not see the real, effective approach to returning the civilian detainees to Ukraine,"" said Dmytro Lubinets, the country's human rights ombudsman. ""We do not have a legal basis or the mechanisms for returning them,"" he said, frankly.

Ukraine Presidential Press Service/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks to SBU chief Vasyl Maliuk after the operation against Russian airbases

It was an attack of astonishing ingenuity – unprecedented, broad, and 18 months in the making. On 1 June more than 100 Ukrainian drones struck air bases deep inside Russia, targeting nuclear-capable long-range bombers. The scale of the operation dubbed ""Spider Web"" became clear almost as soon as it began, with explosions reported across several time zones all over Russia - as far north as Murmansk above the Arctic Circle, and as far east as Irkutsk, over 4,000km from Ukraine.

The Russian Defence Ministry confirmed the attacks had occurred in five regions of Russia - Murmansk, Irkutsk, Ivanovo, Ryazan and Amur - but stated planes had been damaged only in Murmansk and Irkutsk, while in other locations the attacks had been repelled. In photos released shortly after the attack, Vasyl Maliuk, the head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), can be seen looking at a satellite map of airfields in which the bases in the locations listed by Russia are clearly identifiable.

The operation

Maliuk said the drones were first smuggled into Russia, then placed inside wooden cabins mounted on the back of lorries and concealed below remotely operated detachable roofs. The lorries were then apparently driven to locations near airbases by drivers who were seemingly unaware of their cargo; then, the drones were launched and set upon their targets. Videos circulating online show drones emerging from the roof of one of the vehicles involved. One lorry driver interviewed by Russian state outlet Ria Novosti said he and other drivers tried to knock down drones flying out of a lorry with rocks. ""They were in the back of the truck and we threw stones to keep them from flying up, to keep them pinned down,"" he said. According to unverified reports by Russian Telegram channel Baza – which is known for its links to the security services – the drivers of the lorries from which the drones took off all told similar stories of being booked by businessmen to deliver wooden cabins in various locations around Russia.

Some of them said they then received further instructions over the phone on where to park the lorries; when they did so, they were stunned to see drones fly out of them. In a triumphant post shared on social media on Sunday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – who directly supervised the operation - said 117 drones had been used in the daring attack that took ""one year, six months and nine days"" to prepare. He also said one of the targeted locations was right next to one of the offices of the FSB Russian security services.

Russia has said it has detained people in connection with the attack, although Zelensky stated the people who had helped facilitate the operation ""were withdrawn from Russian territory... they are now safe"". In a now-deleted Telegram post, local authorities from the city of Ust-Kut in the Irkutsk region said they were looking for a Ukrainian-born 37-year-old in connection with the drone attack on the Belaya military airfield.

The drones

Images shared by the SBU show dozens of small black drones neatly stashed in wooden cabins inside a warehouse, which Russian military bloggers pinpointed to a location in Chelyabinsk. Dr Steve Wright, a UK-based drone expert, told the BBC the drones used to hit Russian aircraft were simple quadcopters carrying relatively heavy payloads. He added that what made this attack ""quite extraordinary"" was the ability to smuggle them into Russia and then launch and command them remotely – which he concluded had been achieved through a link relayed through a satellite or the internet. Zelensky said each of the 117 drones launched had its own pilot.

SBU The drones were neatly stashed in wooden cabins concealed inside lorries, according to the SBU

Dr Wright also suggested it was likely the drones were able to fly in using GPS but may have also overcome localised Russian jamming measures by manually piloting drones remotely. Kyiv has not shared details on the origin of the drones, but since the start of the war Ukraine has become extremely efficient at manufacturing them – and it is possible the ones used in this operation were produced at home.

The targets

""Russia has had very tangible losses, and justifiably so,"" said Zelensky in his nightly video address. According to Ukraine, 41 strategic bombers were hit and ""at least"" 13 destroyed. Moscow has not confirmed any losses of aircraft beyond saying some planes had been damaged. Videos verified by the BBC show damaged aircraft at the Olenegorsk air base in Murmansk and the Belaya air base in Irkutsk. The strategic missile-carrying bombers targeted in the attack are thought to be – among others - the Tu-95, Tu-22 and Tu-160. Repairing them will be difficult and, because none are still in production, replacing them is impossible. Radar satellite imagery shared by Capella Space reveals at least four badly damaged or destroyed Russian long-range bombers at Belaya airbase. This matches Ukrainian drone footage also showing an attack on a Tu-95 bomber. ""According to the laws and customs of war, we have worked out absolutely legitimate targets – military airfields and aircraft that bomb our peaceful cities,"" said SBU head Vasyl Malyuk.

Tu-95 bombers are said to have launched a large-scale Kh-101 missile attack on Ukraine as recently as last week. Each bomber can carry eight guided cruise missiles and each missile itself carries a 400kg (882lb) warhead. A-50 military spy planes were also reportedly targeted. They are valuable aircraft that boost Russia's ability to both intercept Ukrainian missiles and to launch its own strikes. It is not known how many A-50s Russia has - but in February 2024 military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov put that number at eight, so any loss or damage could be a serious blow to Moscow. In a post on social media, the SBU said operation Spider Web cost Russia $7bn (£5.2bn). Russian state media stayed studiously quiet on the attacks, with primetime Sunday TV shows merely quoting statements by regional authorities. By Monday morning, the story had disappeared from the bulletins. On the internet and beyond Ukrainians celebrated, with one lauding the operation as ""titanic"". ""Of course, not everything can be revealed at this moment,"" Zelensky wrote on Telegram, ""but these are Ukrainian actions that will undoubtedly be in history books.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6ef9/live/98944440-408f-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.jpg

SBU A screengrab of some of the drone footage released by Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday

Three days on, and Ukraine is still digesting the full implications of Operation Spider's Web, Sunday's massive assault on Russia's strategic aviation. On Wednesday, the agency which orchestrated the attack, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), released additional, vivid footage of the attacks in progress, as well as tantalising glimpses into how the whole complex operation was conducted. Satellite images that have emerged since Sunday, showing the wrecked outlines of planes sitting on the tarmac at the Olenya, Ivanovo, Dyagilevo and Belaya airbases, also help tell the story of the operation's unprecedented success. For Ukrainian observers, the whole operation, a year-and-a-half in the making, remains a marvel. ""This can be considered one of the most brilliant operations in our history,"" Roman Pohorlyi, founder of the DeepState, a group of Ukrainian military analysts, told me. ""We've shown that we can be strong, we can be creative and we can destroy our enemies no matter how far away they are.""

Ukraine releases drone footage of operation 'Spider Web'

It's important to note that almost all the information that has emerged since Sunday has been released by the SBU itself. Flushed with its own success, it is keen to cast the operation in the best possible light. Its information campaign has been helped by the fact that the Kremlin has said almost nothing. Speaking to the media on Wednesday after handing out medals to SBU officers involved in the operation, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky repeated the claim that 41 aircraft had been damaged or destroyed. ""Half of them cannot be restored,"" he said, ""and some will take years to repair, if they can be restored at all."" Had a ceasefire been in place, he added, Operation Spider's Web would not have happened.

The latest four-minute compilation released by the SBU shows a number of key details. Shot from the perspective of some of the 117 drones involved, we see Russian strategic bombers, transport aircraft and airborne warning and control (AWACS) being hunted down. Fires can be seen raging on a number of stricken planes. For the first time, we get glimpses under the wings of some of the bombers, revealing that they were already armed with cruise missiles, which Russia has used to devastating effect in its air raids on Ukraine. The drones, many flown remotely by a separate pilot, sitting far away in Ukraine, are carefully and precisely aimed at vulnerable points, including fuel tanks located in the wings. Some of the resulting fireballs also suggest the tanks were full of fuel, ready for take off.

Maxar Technologies A view of Belaya air base shows multiple destroyed military aircraft

One significant section of the video shows drones homing in on two Ilyushin A-50s, giant AWACS aircraft first produced in the Soviet Union. Of all the aircraft targeted by Operation Spider's Web, the A-50, with its radar capable of seeing targets and threats more than 600km (372 miles) away, is arguably the most important. Before the full-scale invasion in 2022, Russia was thought to operate around nine A-50s. Before last Sunday, as many as three had been shot down or damaged in an earlier drone attack. The latest footage strongly implies that drones hit the circular radar domes of the two A-50s parked at the Ivanovo Severny airbase, north-east of Moscow. However, since the video feed cuts out at the moment of impact, this is hard to completely verify. Satellite imagery, which clearly displays the wreckage of numerous bombers, is inconclusive when it comes to the A-50. But Russia's fleet of these crucial aircraft could now be down to as few as four. ""Restarting production of the A-50 is presently highly unlikely, due to difficulties with import substitution and the destruction of production facilities,"" defence analyst Serhii Kuzan told me. ""As such, every loss of this type of aircraft constitutes a strategic problem for Russia, one it cannot quickly compensate for.""

Getty Images Satellite imagery is inconclusive when it comes to the A-50, seen here above Moscow

Earlier on Wednesday, the SBU offered a brief glimpse into another of Sunday's remarkable features: the use of specially constructed containers, mounted on flatbed trucks, to transport armed drones to sites close to the four Russian airbases. Two videos show a truck carrying what appear to be two wooden mobile homes, complete with windows and doors. In one video, roof panels are clearly visible. Reports suggest these were retracted or otherwise removed shortly before the attacks began, allowing dozens of drones stored inside to take off. It's not known when or where the videos were filmed, although snow visible beside the road in one suggests it could have been weeks or months ago. In another video, posted on a Russian Telegram channel on Sunday, a police officer was seen entering the back of one of the containers in the wake of the attack. Seconds later, the container exploded, suggesting it may have been booby-trapped.

SBU The SBU said the drones were stashed in wooden cabins concealed inside lorries

How to assess the impact of such a spectacular operation? ""From a military point of view, this is a turning point in the war,"" aviation expert Anatolii Khrapchynskyi told me. ""Because we have dealt a significant blow to Russia's image and the capabilities of the Russian Federation."" A little over three months after Donald Trump berated Volodymyr Zelensky, telling him he had ""no cards,"" Ukraine has offered an emphatic riposte. ""Ukraine has shown the whole world that Russia is actually weak and cannot defend itself internally,"" Khrapchynskyi said. But that doesn't mean that Russia is about to change course. After his latest conversation with Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump said the two leaders had discussed Ukraine's attacks. ""It was a good conversation,"" President Trump posted on Truth Social, ""but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace."" ""President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1f6a/live/cadcae30-4173-11f0-ad86-8dcd86778e40.png

Getty Images In the fourth year of its full-scale invasion, Russia is still making billions for its war on Ukraine by selling fossil fuels abroad

Russia has continued to make billions from fossil fuel exports to the West, data shows, helping to finance its full-scale invasion of Ukraine – now in its fourth year. Since the start of that invasion in February 2022, Russia has made more than three times as much money by exporting hydrocarbons than Ukraine has received in aid allocated by its allies. Data analysed by the BBC show that Ukraine's Western allies have paid Russia more for its hydrocarbons than they have given Ukraine in aid. Campaigners say governments in Europe and North America need to do more to stop Russian oil and gas from fuelling the war with Ukraine.

How much is Russia still making?

Proceeds made from selling oil and gas are key to keeping Russia's war machine going. Oil and gas account for almost a third of Russia's state revenue and more than 60% of its exports. In the wake of the February 2022 invasion, Ukraine's allies imposed sanctions on Russian hydrocarbons. The US and UK banned Russian oil and gas, while the EU banned Russian seaborne crude imports, but not gas. Despite this, by 29 May, Russia had made more than €883bn ($973bn; £740bn) in revenue from fossil fuel exports since the start of the full-scale invasion, including €228bn from the sanctioning countries, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). The lion's share of that amount, €209bn, came from EU member states. EU states continued importing pipeline gas directly from Russia until Ukraine cut the transit in January 2025, and Russian crude oil is still piped to Hungary and Slovakia. Russian gas is still piped to Europe in increasing quantities via Turkey: CREA's data shows that its volume rose by 26.77% in January and February 2025 over the same period in 2024. Hungary and Slovakia are also still receiving Russian pipeline gas via Turkey.

Despite the West's efforts, in 2024 Russian revenues from fossil fuels fell by a mere 5% compared with 2023, along with a similar 6% drop in the volumes of exports, according to CREA. Last year also saw a 6% increase in Russian revenues from crude oil exports, and a 9% year-on-year increase in revenues from pipeline gas. Russian estimates say gas exports to Europe rose by up to 20% in 2024, with liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports reaching record levels. Currently, half of Russia's LNG exports go the EU, CREA says. The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, says the alliance has not imposed ""the strongest sanctions"" on Russian oil and gas because some member states fear an escalation in the conflict and because buying them is ""cheaper in the short term"". LNG imports have not been included in the latest, 17th package of sanctions on Russia approved by the EU, but it has adopted a road map towards ending all Russian gas imports by the end of 2027. Data shows that money made by Russia from selling fossil fuels has consistently surpassed the amount of aid Ukraine receives from its allies. The thirst for fuel can get in the way of the West's efforts to limit Russia's ability to fund its war. Mai Rosner, a senior campaigner from the pressure group Global Witness, says many Western policymakers fear that cutting imports of Russian fuels will lead to higher energy prices. ""There's no real desire in many governments to actually limit Russia's ability to produce and sell oil. There is way too much fear about what that would mean for global energy markets. There's a line drawn under where energy markets would be too undermined or too thrown off kilter,"" she told the BBC.

'Refining loophole'

In addition to direct sales, some of the oil exported by Russia ends up in the West after being processed into fuel products in third countries via what is known as ""the refining loophole"". Sometimes it gets diluted with crude from other countries, too. CREA says it has identified three ""laundromat refineries"" in Turkey and three in India processing Russian crude and selling the resulting fuel on to sanctioning countries. It says they have used €6.1bn worth of Russian crude to make products for sanctioning countries. India's petroleum ministry criticised CREA's report as ""a deceptive effort to tarnish India's image"".

""[These countries] know that sanctioning countries are willing to accept this. This is a loophole. It's entirely legal. Everyone's aware of it, but nobody is doing much to actually tackle it in a big way,"" says Vaibhav Raghunandan, an analyst at CREA. Campaigners and experts argue that Western governments have the tools and means available to stem the flow of oil and gas revenue into the Kremlin's coffers. According to former Russian deputy energy minister Vladimir Milov, who is now a diehard opponent of Vladimir Putin, sanctions imposed on trade in Russian hydrocarbons should be better enforced - particularly the oil price cap adopted by the G7 group of nations, which Mr Milov says ""is not working"". He is fearful, though, that the US government shake-up launched by President Donald Trump will hamper agencies such as the US Treasury or the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which are key for sanctions enforcement. Another avenue is continued pressure on Russia's ""shadow fleet"" of tankers involved in dodging the sanctions. ""That is a complex surgery operation. You need to periodically release batches of new sanctioned vessels, shell companies, traders, insurers etc. every several weeks,"" Mr Milov says. According to him, this is an area where Western governments have been much more effective, particularly with the introduction of new sanctions by Joe Biden's outgoing administration in January 2025. Mai says that banning Russian LNG exports to Europe and closing the refining loophole in Western jurisdictions would be ""important steps in finishing the decoupling of the West from Russian hydrocarbons"". According to Mr Raghunandan from CREA, it would be relatively easy for the EU to give up Russian LNG imports. ""Fifty percent of their LNG exports are directed towards the European Union, and only 5% of the EU's total [LNG] gas consumption in 2024 was from Russia. So if the EU decides to completely cut off Russian gas, it's going to hurt Russia way more then it's going to hurt consumers in the European Union,"" he told the BBC.

Trump's oil-price plan to end war

Experts interviewed by the BBC have dismissed Donald Trump's idea that the war with Ukraine will end if Opec brings oil prices down. ""People in Moscow are laughing at this idea, because the party which will suffer the most… is the American shale oil industry, the least cost-competitive oil industry in the world,"" Mr Milov told the BBC. Mr Raghunandan says that Russia's budget break even cost of crude is also lower than in Opec countries like Saudi Arabia, so they would be hurt by lower oil prices before Russia. ""There is no way that Saudi Arabia is going to agree to that. This has been tried before. This has led to conflict between Saudi Arabia and the US,"" he says. Ms Rosner says there are both moral and practical issues with the West buying Russian hydrocarbons while supporting Ukraine. ""We now have a situation in which we are funding the aggressor in a war that we're condemning and also funding the resistance to the war,"" she says. ""This dependence on fossil fuels means that we are really at the whims of energy markets, global energy producers and hostile dictators.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/645e/live/4b1e3c90-3d31-11f0-b6e6-4ddb91039da1.jpg

Watch: BBC team flees drone attack in Ukraine

An acrid smell hangs over the town of Rodynske. A couple of minutes after we drive into the city we see where it's coming from. A 250kg glide bomb has ripped through the town's main administrative building, and taken down three residential blocks. We're visiting a day after the bomb struck, but parts of the wreckage are still smoking. From the edges of the town we hear the sound of artillery fire, and of gunshots – Ukrainian soldiers shooting down drones. Rodynske is about 15km (9 miles) north of the embattled city of Pokrovsk. Russia has been trying to capture it from the south since the autumn of last year, but Ukrainian forces have so far managed to stop Russian soldiers from marching in. So Russia has changed tactics, moving instead to encircle the city, cutting off supply routes. In the past two weeks, as hectic diplomatic efforts to bring about a ceasefire in Ukraine have failed, Russia has intensified its push, making its most significant advances since January. We find proof of that in Rodynske. Within minutes of us arriving in town, we hear a Russian drone above us. Our team runs to the closest cover available – a tree.

We press up against it so the drone won't see us. Then there's the sound of a loud explosion – it's a second drone making impact nearby. The drone above us is still hovering. For a few more minutes, we hear the terrifying whirring sound of what's become the deadliest weapon of this war. When we can't hear it any more we take the chance to run to hard cover in an abandoned building 100ft away. From the shelter, we hear the drone again. It's possible it returned after seeing our movement. That Rodynske is being swarmed by Russian drones is evidence that the attacks are coming from positions much closer than known Russian positions to the south of Pokrovsk. They were most likely coming from newly captured territory on a key road running from the east of Pokrovsk to Kostyantynivka. After half an hour of waiting in the shelter, when we can't hear the drone anymore, we move quickly to our car parked under tree cover, and speed out of Rodynske. By the side of the highway we see smoke billowing and something burning – it's most likely a downed drone.

Towns like Rodynske are now ruined shells, pummelled by Russian air assaults

We drive to Bilytske, further away from the frontline. We see a row of houses destroyed by a missile strike overnight. One of them was Svitlana's home. ""It's getting worse and worse. Earlier, we could hear distant explosions, they were far away. But now our town is getting targeted – we're experiencing it ourselves,"" says the 61-year-old, as she picks up a few belongings from the wreckage of her home. Luckily Svitlana wasn't at home when the attack occurred. ""Go into the centre of the town, you'll see so much that is destroyed there. And the bakery and zoo have been destroyed too,"" she says. At a safehouse just out of reach of drones, we meet soldiers of the artillery unit of the 5th Assault Brigade. ""You can feel the intensity of Russian assaults increasing. Rockets, mortars, drones, they're using everything they have to cut off supply routes going into the city,"" says Serhii. His unit has been waiting for three days to deploy to their positions, waiting for cloud cover or high-speed winds to give them protection from drones.

Serhii's unit had to wait days to deploy to their frontline positions, because of the drone threat

In an ever-evolving conflict, soldiers have had to rapidly adapt to new threats posed by changing technology. And the latest threat comes from fibre optic drones. A spool of tens of kilometres of cable is fitted to the bottom of a drone and the physical fibre optic cord is attached to the controller held by the pilot. ""The video and control signal is transmitted to and from the drone through the cable, not through radio frequencies. This means it can't be jammed by electronic interceptors,"" says a soldier with the call sign Moderator, a drone engineer with the 68th Jaeger Brigade. When drones began to be used in this war in a big way, both militaries fitted their vehicles with electronic warfare systems, which could neutralise drones. That protection has evaporated with the arrival of fibre optic drones, and in the deployment of these devices, Russia currently has the edge. Ukraine is trying to ramp up production. ""Russia started using fibre optic drones much before us, while we were still testing them. These drones can be used in places where we have to go lower than usual drones. We can even enter houses and look for targets inside,"" says Venia, a drone pilot with the 68th Jaeger Brigade. ""We've started joking that maybe we should carry scissors to cut the cord,"" says Serhii, the artillery man. Fibre optic drones do have drawbacks – they are slower and the cable could get entangled in trees. But at the moment, their widespread use by Russia means that transporting soldiers to and from their positions can often be deadlier than the battlefield itself.

Moderator works on Ukrainian fibre optic drones, to use against the invaders

""When you enter a position, you don't know whether you've been spotted or not. And if you have been spotted, then you may already be living the last hours of your life,"" says Oles, Chief Sergeant of the reconnaissance unit of the 5th Assault Brigade. This threat means that soldiers are spending longer and longer in their positions. Oles and his men are in the infantry, serving in the trenches right at the very front of Ukraine's defence. It's rare for journalists these days to speak to infantrymen, as it's become too risky to go to these trenches. We meet Oles and Maksym in a rural home converted into a makeshift base, where the soldiers come to rest when they're not on deployment. ""The longest I spent at the position was 31 days, but I do know guys who have spent 90 and even 120 days there. Back before the drones arrived, the rotations could have been between 3 or 7 days at the position,"" says Maksym. ""War is blood, death, wet mud and a chill that spreads from head to toe. And this is how you spend every day. I remember one instance when we didn't sleep for three days, alert every minute. The Russians kept coming at us wave after wave. Even a minor lapse would have meant we were dead."" Oles says Russia's infantry has changed its tactics. ""Earlier they attacked in groups. Now they only send one or two people at times. They also use motorcycles and in a few instances, quad bikes. Sometimes they slip through."" What this means is that the front lines in some parts are no longer conventional lines with the Ukrainians on one side and the Russians on the other, but more like pieces on a chessboard during play, where positions can be intertwined. This also makes it harder to see advances made by either side.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8cf9/live/08c85260-3c58-11f0-aa24-d1c64c46ace6.jpg

BBC Some soldiers like Kozak believe too many people have been killed to hand over land to Russia

Big plumes of smoke are visible on a screen that's providing a live feed from Ukrainian drones hovering over the outskirts of the eastern city of Pokrovsk, one of the most intense front lines in Ukraine. A few seconds earlier, Ukrainian artillery strikes Russian positions, places where we'd seen Russian soldiers moving about as they try to advance towards a key road going into Pokrovsk. At least one Russian soldier is injured, possibly dead after the strike. It's chilling to watch the live footage. It drives home the bloody consequences of the war that Russia started, in which hundreds of thousands have so far been killed, a ""never-ending bloodbath"" as US President Donald Trump calls it. We are in a rural house converted into a command centre for the 155th mechanised brigade of the Ukrainian army. It's a few miles from front-line artillery positions. The scale of the devastation that we see on the screens, homes and buildings completely flattened, is far greater than what we saw six months ago. It is evidence of the fierce battle that has been fought over the past several months to defend Pokrovsk, a crucial transport hub in the Donetsk region.

This week, there's cautious optimism, even among sceptical soldiers who have witnessed hopes of a ceasefire being dashed over and over again, as diplomatic efforts from the US, Europe, Turkey and others have pushed Russia and Ukraine to direct talks for the first time in three years. ""I think something should happen since Russia was the first one to push for these talks. I mean since 2022, they have refused to go into any contact,"" says an officer who wants to be referred to with his call sign ""Kozak"". ""I want to believe this would be the beginning of the end of the war. ""But now I see, we have been successful in destroying their rear positions and their supply lines. Russia does not have the same strength and power it had at the beginning. So I think that something will happen.""

Yurii (R) does not believe Russia will stop if Ukraine gives up territory now

Yurii, 37, used to work in a technology company before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. ""They (Russia and Ukraine) have to start talking. Us soldiers, we wish this war would end. But it's important to remember that we cannot stop it because we did not start it,"" he says. He looks up at the screen and spots Russian soldiers moving again. He and his colleagues calculate the co-ordinates of their positions and pass them on to their artillery unit.

Watch: BBC's Yogita Limaye joins Ukrainian soldiers on the front line

We drive from the command centre to the artillery position, on mud tracks running through a wide expanse of open fields. Clumps of mud fly in the air, our car slips and slides, as we move as fast as possible. The speed is a mitigation against strikes from drones, which have sharply increased fatalities for both Russia and Ukraine since they were deployed in large numbers in 2023. And war technology keeps evolving. Now there's a new threat – drones equipped with a real fibre optic cable which unrolls as they fly. ""We cannot detect them or neutralise them, so there are probably a lot more drones in the area right now than we know,"" says Yurii. As we drive into the artillery position hidden under trees and bushes, soldiers are already loading the gun. It's a French made self-propelled artillery gun called the ""Caesar"". Scores have been deployed in Ukraine since the start of the war, and France has been trying to ramp up production.

France has been sending dozens of Caesar self-propelled artillery guns to Ukraine since 2022

""I'm very impressed by its accuracy, and we can use a large range of ammunition. The most important thing is that bringing it into combat is very fast. It is much more effective than the old Soviet equipment I've used,"" says Kozak. Ukrainian soldiers fire four rounds, each one emitting a deafening sound. From around us, we also hear the sound of incoming shells. The battle rages on. ""As you can hear, there is a wave of assaults from the enemy and we need a lot of ammunition to suppress that. We hope our international partners can give us as much ammunition as possible, because if we have to start choosing priority and non-priority targets then the enemy will be successful,"" says Kozak. We ask the soldiers how they feel about suggestions that Ukraine will have to make concessions, that it might have to give up land to secure peace. ""It's painful to hear that. Even I want to go home to my family. My daughter is eight and I miss her so much. But we need to be strong. I don't believe that if we give up some territory, they will stop. In a couple of years, they will return and start over,"" says Yurii. ""A person who has not come here, who hasn't felt the consequences of Russian aggression, those armchair commentators say you can give up land and everything will be over. They will never understand how many brothers and friends we have lost. We shouldn't give up a single metre of our land,"" says Kozak.

The impact of three years of war can be seen everywhere across Ukraine

The cost Ukraine has paid to defend its land is visible everywhere, most acutely in the photos of smiling, young soldiers posted by the side of highways, on memorial walls in central city squares, and on rows and rows of freshly dug graves in the country. Yana Melnikova lovingly buys her son's favourite treats - a cup of steaming hot chocolate and a chocolate roll. Then she drives out to a cemetery in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, and places them neatly by 22-year-old Vladislav's grave. She and her daughter, 13-year-old Nicole, wipe the grave with wet tissues. Before long, they break down inconsolably into each other's arms. Vladislav was a drone operator with the Ukrainian military. He was killed in combat in a Russian strike on 21 February this year. For Yana, news of direct talks resuming bring no hope. ""It seems to me that this war is eternal. Of course, I hope they will find a solution. Because people are dying here and there (in Russia). But Putin is greedy. His hunger for our land is insatiable,"" says Yana.

BBC

Fighting has raged in Ukraine since Russia launched a full-scale invasion more than three years ago. Russian forces have slowly expanded the amount of territory they control over the past year, mostly in the east of Ukraine. Here is a recap of recent significant events and the situation in Ukraine.

Russia grinds forward in the east

In eastern Ukraine, Moscow's war machine has been churning mile by mile through the wide open fields of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, enveloping and overwhelming villages and towns. It is trying to capture the rest of the region, known as the Donbas, according to US-based analysts at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), but the front line has barely moved for two years.

Russia's biggest advantage is manpower and it has shown a willingness to throw soldiers at Ukrainian positions to gain a few metres at a time - with at least 45,000 Russian troops killed in the past year alone. Ukrainian military intelligence says about 620,000 Russian soldiers are operating in Ukraine and Kursk. Kyiv believes thousands of troops have entered Ukraine since the start of the year. Fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops intensified in recent weeks, with assaults on the front line up by about 30%, according to Ukrainian military chiefs, who believed they were part of a spring offensive by Russia. Why did Putin's Russia invade Ukraine? Until now Russian forces have been advancing slowly north and west of Donetsk, towards the city of Pokrovsk, and have recently been closing a Ukrainian pocket along the front line south west of Toretsk, according to experts at the ISW.

The Russian advance towards Pokrovsk is the most notable change in control of the front line near Donetsk for several months, but analysts say innovative tactics by Ukrainian forces, combining the use of drones and ground forces, have inflicted significant losses of troops and equipment and slowed the offensive. It has taken a year for Russia's troops to advance about 40km (25 miles). Ukraine was forced to withdraw from Avdiivka, just north of Donetsk, in February 2024 after months of fighting.

Russian incursion north of Kharkiv

In addition to its operation on the eastern front, Russia began what the ISW describes as its ""subordinate main effort"" when it crossed the international border to the north of Ukraine's second-biggest city, Kharkiv, in May 2024. Several villages were seized and thousands of civilians fled.

The Russian push took place at the end of a four-month period when the US was not supplying weapons to Ukraine, due to a stalemate in the US Congress which was resolved in April 2024. Ukrainian forces eventually held firm and, even though the city of Kharkiv has come under repeated attack from glide bombs fired by Russian warplanes, it remains beyond the range of Russian artillery.

Ukraine suggests territory swap

Eastern Ukraine has been contested territory since 2014, when Russian-backed fighters seized large swathes of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Russia had already seized the southern peninsula of Crimea in February 2014 before annexing it soon afterwards. US President Donald Trump has said it is unlikely Ukraine will return to its pre-2014 borders but, in response to a question from the BBC, he said ""some of that land will come back"". In an interview with the Guardian, published on 11 February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that Russian-held territory in Ukraine could be swapped for territory seized by Ukraine in Russia's western Kursk region in recent months as part of a peace deal. Ukraine seized control of part of the region in a surprise attack launched across the border by Ukrainian troops in August, advancing up to 18 miles (30km) into the Russian region. After two weeks, Ukraine's top commander claimed to control more than 1,200 sq km of Russian territory and 93 villages but Russia has since reclaimed much of that territory. Fighting is continuing in the region more than a week after Moscow said it had pushed Ukrainian troops out. Ukraine says its forces are still active there and have continued drone, air and artillery strikes in the area - particularly around the village of Tetkino.

Ceasefire talks

The US, Ukraine's strongest military ally, has been pursuing an end to the war - now in its fourth year - through negotiation since Trump took office at the start of the year. However, Zelensky and Trump have repeatedly clashed and tensions have been high since a heated confrontation at the White House in February during which Trump accused Zelensky of ""gambling with World War Three"" and chided him for not starting peace talks with Russia earlier. By contrast, the US president has made efforts to improve relations with Moscow, although he did say he was ""very angry"" with Russia's President Vladimir Putin at the end of March after ceasefire talks between US and Russian officials stalled. On 30 April the US and Ukraine signed a long-discussed deal to share profits from the future sale of Ukraine's mineral and energy reserves. The deal aims to provide an economic incentive for the US to continue to invest in Ukraine's defence and reconstruction - as well as to address Washington's concerns over the amount of aid it has already contributed.

It will also see the establishment of an investment fund to spur Ukraine's economic recovery from the war. After the deal was signed US Vice-President JD Vance said the war was ""not going to end any time soon"" and that the question facing the US administration now was how it could help Russia and Ukraine ""find middle ground"" to end the conflict.

Three years of fighting

Russia's full-scale invasion began with dozens of missile strikes on cities all over Ukraine before dawn on 24 February 2022. Russian ground troops moved in quickly and within a few weeks were in control of large areas of Ukraine and had advanced to the suburbs of Kyiv. Russian forces were bombarding Kharkiv, and they had taken territory in the east and south as far as Kherson, and surrounded the port city of Mariupol.

But they hit very strong Ukrainian resistance almost everywhere and faced serious logistical problems with poorly motivated Russian troops suffering shortages of food, water and ammunition. Ukrainian forces were also quick to deploy Western supplied arms such as the Nlaw anti-tank system, which proved highly effective against the Russian advance. By October 2022, the picture had changed dramatically and, having failed to take Kyiv, Russia withdrew completely from the north. The following month, Ukrainian forces recaptured the southern city of Kherson. Since then, the battle has mostly been in the east of Ukraine with Russian forces slowly gaining ground over many months - military experts estimate between 165,000 and 235,000 Russian service personnel have been killed since the invasion. Ukraine last updated its casualty figures in December 2024, when President Zelensky acknowledged 43,000 Ukrainian deaths among soldiers and officers. Western analysts believe this figure to be an under-estimate.

Artem Kariakin Artem and his unit would regularly cross into Russia - until last week

Until just over a week ago, Artem Kariakin and his unit were making regular trips across Ukraine's border into the Russian town of Sudzha. He shows me video taken with a phone of their very last trip, as Ukrainian forces retreated from Russia's Kursk region. It shows them making their way past dozens of burnt out military and civilian vehicles. A soldier armed with a shotgun, their last line of defence, scans the horizon for Russian drones. Out of nowhere, one flies towards the back of their truck. Sparks fly, but they keep on going. Artem says they were lucky - the explosive charge was not big enough to stop them. Another truck nearby was less fortunate. It was already in flames. Artem admits Ukraine's retreat from Sudzha, the largest town Ukraine held in Kursk, was ""not well organised"". ""It was pretty chaotic,"" he tells me. ""Many units left in disarray. I think the problem was the order to withdraw came too late."" It wasn't helped, he says, because units were operating without proper communications. The Starlink satellite systems they normally rely on didn't work inside Russia.

The 27-year-old soldier still views the Kursk offensive as broadly successful. Artem says it forced Russia to divert its forces from the east. Most of Ukraine's troops still managed to escape in time – even if for many it was on foot. But he believes Ukraine's surprise incursion into Russian territory, launched last August, was too deep and too narrow - relying on just one main road for supplies and reinforcements. While Artem and his men were fleeing for their lives, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were talking by phone about trying to bring the war to an end. Artem says he finds that ""absurd"". ""To me these calls between Trump and Putin are just surreal,"" he says. ""Trump wants to end the war because he promised to do it - and Putin wants to deceive Trump to continue his war. I can't take their conversations seriously."" Artem, whose home is in the now Russian-occupied Luhansk region, tells me he feels disappointed with the US and Trump. ""What can I feel when they just want to give away my home?""

Artem Kariakin Ukraine's incursion in August 2024 caught Russia by surprise

Artem says he never believed that Putin would be willing to trade any part of Russia for Ukraine's occupied territories. But he still believes the Kursk offensive was important to protect its own border. Ukrainian troops may have been forced to retreat, but they still occupy high ground just over the border with Sumy. Ukraine is continuing its cross-border raids – not just into Kursk, but Belgorod too. Serhiy's assault battalion helps plan these attacks – finding a way through Russian minefields and anti-tank obstacles known as ""dragon's teeth"". We joined him on a night-time mission to locate and recover armoured vehicles in need of repairs. It's the safest time to move close to the Russian border. Serhiy himself is no stranger to Russia: he was born there. He now has Belorussian citizenship, but he chose to fight for Ukraine. He justifies Ukraine's incursions into his former home. Russia too, he says, has been trying to create a buffer zone inside Ukrainian territory. Travelling in his Ukrainian-made armoured vehicle, Serhiy still lists the likely threats, now we are less than 10km from the Russian border: glide bombs, rockets and artillery, and drones fitted with thermal imaging cameras.

BBC/Matthew Goddard Serhiy fights for Ukraine against the country of his birth

His own vehicle is fitted with electronic counter-measures to jam enemy drones, but even those won't work against drones operated via fibre optic wires. Those can't be stopped, though on some routes Ukraine has now erected netting to try to catch the drones before they can hit their target. Our original search near the Russian border for a damaged US-made Bradley armoured vehicle is abandoned when Serhiy receives intelligence that Russian drones are operating nearby. Instead, he tries to locate another broken-down Bradley where the risks will be smaller. He and his driver still have to overcome obstacles along the way. Trees and branches lie strewn across their path – remnants from a recent Russian air strike. We see several more explosions in the distance, briefly turning the night sky orange. Serhiy eventually finds his broken-down Bradley. It's already been retrieved from the battlefield across the border and has been loaded onto a lorry to be taken back for repairs.

Matthew Goddard Ukrainian soldiers on the battlefield say they don't expect to see the war end any time soon

While Moscow considers a temporary ceasefire, its military machine continues to press its advantage on the front line. Diplomatic negotiations can be slow and difficult. But on the battlefield, they can be measured in lost lives. At a military hospital in eastern Ukraine, the injured arrive by ambulance in waves. Here, there's an obvious disconnect between diplomacy taking place, far from the fighting, and the brutality of battle – where human bodies are still being smashed, shredded and scarred by bombs and bullets. We watch another two dozen injured Ukrainian soldiers being loaded on to a bus to be taken to a hospital in Dnipro – some walking wounded, others carried on stretchers. The bus is fitted out with medical equipment to monitor the injured as they're driven fast over potholed roads. The men on board are the less severely wounded. Most have been hit by shrapnel. The cause is often what's now the most prolific and feared weapon on the front line – drones. None of those we talked to believe this war will be ending any time soon. Thirty-year-old Maksym is on a stretcher with an IV drip to relieve some of the pain from several shrapnel wounds across his body. He says he'd heard the talk of a temporary 30-day ceasefire, but adds: ""I consider Putin a murderer and murderers don't agree so easily.""

Matthew Goddard Ukrainian soldier Maksym has several shrapnel wounds and is being given painkillers via a drip

Vova, who's sitting up nearby, says: ""I don't believe it."" He says that near the besieged city of Pokrovsk, they were facing Russian storm attacks every single day. ""I doubt there will be a truce,"" he tells me. Another soldier named Maksym says this is the second time he has been injured. ""I don't believe there will be a ceasefire,"" he says. ""I had a lot of friends who are not with us any more. ""I would like to believe that all will be good. But you can't trust Russia. Never."" The large medical bus is operated by Ukraine's Volunteer Army Medical Battalion – known as the Hospitallers. They transport scores of injured soldiers every day. Sofiia, a 22-year-old medical student, has been working with the team for the last 18 months. She too is sceptical about the chances of a ceasefire: "" I cannot believe it, but I really wish it would happen,"" she says. She tells me that when she first heard the news that the US and Ukraine had agreed to press for a ceasefire, Russian drones were flying over their base, being engaged by Ukrainian air defences. To her, talk of peace is from a parallel universe. Sofiia says ""at least it's good that Ukraine and America are talking again"". But as for hopes of any ceasefire, she points to the recent past. ""Looking at all the ceasefire calls that we had in the past, those didn't work. How is this going to work?"" she asks. Her fellow medic, Daniel, joined the Hospitallers from Sweden. He says he understands what it's like when a smaller nation is attacked by its giant neighbour. His grandfather fought for Finland against Russia during World War Two. History counts. When Daniel first arrived in Ukraine, he used to ask injured soldiers what they would do after the war. He doesn't any more. ""No-one wants to answer that,"" he says, ""because they don't want to be disappointed. They don't dare to hope."" Daniel's not ruling out a ceasefire. But he adds: ""You can't trust Putin to do anything that's not beneficial to Putin."" Ukraine has plenty of bitter experience of negotiating with Russia. France and Germany brokered ceasefires in 2014 and 2015, when Russian-backed forces first took parts of eastern Ukraine and Crimea. They didn't work. Nor did they deter Russia from carrying out its full-scale invasion of Ukraine eight years later. Why did Putin's Russia invade Ukraine?

BBC Dr Stephen Reaney volunteers with a Christian organisation

""One day you're working in Craigavon Area Hospital; the next, you're boarding a flight to a war zone."" Dr Stephen Reaney, from Northern Ireland, travels the world as a volunteer, providing urgent medical care in disaster-hit countries. In 2023, he worked in southern Turkey, after a deadly earthquake killed more than 55,000 people. The year before that, Dr Reaney was in Ukraine, after Russia launched a full-scale military invasion.

An example of one of the organisation's tent-like hospital rooms was on display at Dundonald Elim Church

""We're seeing the typical war casualties – men, women, and children,"" he told BBC News NI. ""It's very traumatic for the staff, but you just get on with it, particularly when children come in with severe burns, for example, it can be very distressing. ""But we do our best for our patients.""

When he is at home, Dr Reaney works as an urgent care doctor for the Southern Health and Social Care Trust. But for about four months of the year, he travels with the Christian organisation Samaritan's Purse to countries worst hit by crises. It sets up field hospitals to provide emergency care. He described how a woman who had been trapped in a collapsed building following the Turkey earthquake survived after receiving two weeks of intensive care at the field hospital there.

Dr Reaney says the team treats patients who have come through ""some horrendous experiences"" with limited resources

Trump's call with Putin was the first since a major Ukraine attack on missile-carrying aircraft deep inside Russia

Trump warned in a social media post that the phone call, which lasted more than an hour, would not ""lead to immediate peace"" between Russia and Ukraine.

Russian officials declined to confirm this on Wednesday night, but Moscow had earlier said that military options were ""on the table"" for its response.

Speaking after a phone call with the Russian president, the US president said: ""President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields.""

Vladimir Putin has said he will have to respond to Ukraine's major drone attack on Russian airbases, Donald Trump has warned.

Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti reported that Putin told Trump that Ukraine had tried to ""disrupt"" the negotiations and that the government in Kyiv has ""essentially turned into a terrorist organisation"".

The two also ""exchanged views on the prospects for restoring cooperation between the countries, which has enormous potential"", it said.

The conversation between the two leaders is the first since Ukraine launched a surprise attack using smuggled drones to strike Russian airbases on 1 June, targeting what it said were nuclear-capable long-range bombers.

Trump told Putin during the call that the US was not warned in advance of the attack, Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov said.

Ukraine's Minister of Strategic Industries Yuriy Sak told Radio 4's World Tonight programme that his country had hoped the US would respond to the ""incessant Russian missile and drone attacks"" with ""more sanctions and with more pressure"".

Last week, Trump appeared to set a two-week deadline for Putin, threatening to change how the US is responding to Russia if he believed Putin was still ""tapping"" him along on peace efforts in Ukraine.

The comment was one of a string of critical remarks by Trump, who on 26 May said that Putin had gone ""absolutely crazy"" and was ""playing with fire"" after Russia escalated drone and missile attacks on cities in Ukraine, killing dozens of civilians.

Trump made no mention of a deadline nor his previous remarks in Wednesday's post on his Truth Social platform.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on X about the scale Russian attacks on his country since Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022.

""Many have spoken with Russia at various levels. But none of these talks have brought a reliable peace, or even stopped the war,"" he said.

""If the world reacts weakly to Putin's threats, he interprets it as a readiness to turn a blind eye to his actions.""

On Wednesday, a delegation of Ukrainian officials including Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko and Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak were set to meet US senators in Washington to discuss arms purchases and efforts to stop the fighting.

Yermak said on social media that the delegation planned to discuss ""defense support and the situation on the battlefield"", sanctions against Russia and a previously signed reconstruction investment fund.

Trump's warning also comes just days after a second round of direct peace talks in Istanbul between the warring sides ended without a major breakthrough, although they agreed to swap more prisoners of war.

Ukrainian negotiators said Russia rejected an ""unconditional ceasefire"" - a key demand of Kyiv and its Western allies including the US.

The Russian team said they had proposed multi-day ceasefires in ""certain areas"" of the frontline in Ukraine, although they gave no further details.

Trump has previously - and repeatedly - said he believes the two sides are making progress, despite ongoing fighting on the frontline and aerial attacks carried out in both Russia and Ukraine.

Separately on Wednesday, Putin also had a call with the US-born Pope Leo XIV.

BBC

New satellite images and drone footage show serious damage inflicted on aircraft at several Russian airbases during Ukraine's surprise drone strike on Sunday. The images of two Russian airbases in north-western and central Russia, taken on Wednesday morning, show 12 aircraft damaged or destroyed. Meanwhile, drone footage, released by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on Wednesday, showed attacks on these two bases as well as two more targeted elsewhere. Ukraine claims that it targeted 41 strategic bombers in the operation, adding that ""at least"" 13 were destroyed. Security officials say the shock incursion took 18 months to plan and saw many drones smuggled into Russia.

Drone attacks recorded

The SBU video is almost five minutes long and consists of edited footage taken by drones in the process of conducting attacks on Olenya, Ivanovo, Dyagilevo and Belaya airbases. In each shot the feed cuts out before any explosion, but in some instances we see other planes on fire in the background.

At no point do we see any indication of defensive measures from Russian forces, even after the attack was clearly well underway. Many of the aircraft are covered in tyres - a Russian tactic said to be aimed at mitigating against drone strikes. Some of the aircraft are seen apparently loaded with cruise missiles and well fuelled - judging by the extent and spread of fires. This suggests they were prepared to conduct strikes.

The clearest satellite imagery covers Olenya and Belaya and shows five damaged or destroyed planes at the former and seven at the latter.

Olenya

Olenya is a major Russian airbase in the north-west of the country. The SBU footage shows smoke pouring from three aircraft, identified as Tu-95 strategic bombers and an approach to a fourth. Video footage also shows a drone approaching a Tu-22M strategic bomber sitting on the runway in this very same position. Satellite imagery from Maxar clearly shows a destroyed aircraft sitting beside a row of Tu-22M type aircraft.

Manufacturing of both the Tu-95 and Tu-22 ended at the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, which will make repair difficult and replacement near impossible. Elsewhere in the SBU video, an AN-12 Transporter can be seen being approached. The Maxar satellite image does not show the aftermath of this, but other imagery reviewed by BBC Verify from AviVector - a satellite image analyst on X - suggests that it too was destroyed.

Belaya

Imagery provided by Planet Labs from this morning shows the entirety of Belaya airbase in Irkutsk Oblast, nearly 3,000km from the Ukrainian border.

It shows three damaged Tu-95s and four Tu-22s and in various parts of the base. The SBU footage shows many of the same aircraft being approached. In two instances we see the drone carefully position itself on the wing of a Tu-95 - next to one of its fuel tanks. The final shot of the footage shows smoke rising from numerous sites across the base.

Ivanovo

At Ivanovo airbase two A50-AWACS planes are seen being targeted. The aircraft serves as an early warning and control asset - or spy plane - and is identifiable by the sizeable radar system on its fuselage. Ukraine previously shot down two of these aircraft in January and February 2024. As yet we have not seen any imagery or footage that captures any damage to these aircraft at Ivanovo. While satellite imagery from the site does show wreckage, BBC Verify has confirmed that the damage was present at the site before Sunday's attack and is likely from another incident.

Ukraine uses underwater explosive on Crimean bridge

However, later in the day, local authorities warned the bridge was temporarily closed again.

Russian media initially said the bridge was briefly closed to traffic but that it had reopened by 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT).

The ""first explosive device"" was detonated ""without any civilian casualties"", the SBU added. The information shared by the SBU could not be immediately verified.

The SBU said it had ""mined the supports"" of the bridge with explosives equivalent to 1,100kg of TNT, which ""severely damaged"" the bottom level of the supports.

Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) said it targeted the Crimea bridge with underwater explosives on Tuesday following an operation lasting ""several months"".

Unconfirmed reports on social media said more explosions had occurred around the structure.

The official Telegram channel sharing operational updates about the bridge said: ""We ask those on the bridge and in the inspection zone to remain calm and follow the instructions of the transport security officers.""

Russia has not yet commented on Tuesday morning's attack but Russian military bloggers speculated that an underwater drone, rather than explosive, had hit a protective barrier.

The SBU said its director, Lieutenant General Vasyl Malyuk, personally supervised the operation and coordinated its planning.

In a Telegram post, it quoted Malyuk as saying Ukraine had hit the Crimea bridge in 2022 and 2023 and was therefore ""continuing this tradition under water.""

""No illegal Russian facilities have a place on the territory of our state,"" Malyuk said.

""Therefore, the Crimean Bridge is an absolutely legitimate target, especially considering that the enemy used it as a logistical artery to supply its troops.""

The bridge - also known as Kerch Bridge - was built by Russia after it invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. It was inaugurated by Russian President Vladimir Putin to great fanfare in 2018.

In Ukraine, the bridge is a hated symbol of Russian occupation. Moscow guards it carefully - which makes any attack on it, whether with underwater drones or explosives, a remarkable achievement.

Tuesday's strike on the bridge comes barely 48 hours after Ukraine hit several targets across Russia as part of an operation dubbed 'Spider Web'.

Kyiv said it smuggled more than 100 drones into Russia and managed to get them delivered near air bases by unsuspecting lorry drivers.

The drones then flew out of the lorries and attacked Russia's prized strategic bombers in locations across the country.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6f72/live/ff26fb00-4088-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.jpg
